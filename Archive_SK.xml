'''Charles Milles Manson''' ({{né}} '''Maddox''', November 12, 1934{{snd}}November 19, 2017) was an American criminal and cult leader. In mid-1967, he formed what became known as the "[[Manson Family]]", a quasi-commune based in California. His followers committed [[Manson Family murders|a series of nine murders]] at four locations in July and August 1969. According to the Los Angeles County district attorney, Manson plotted to start a race war, though he and others disputed this motive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Goodbye Helter Skelter|last=Stimson|first=George|publisher=The Peasenhall Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-9913725-8-4|location=California|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to commit murder for the [[Tate murders|deaths of seven people]], including the film actress [[Sharon Tate]]. The prosecution conceded that Manson never literally ordered the murders, but they contended that his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/61/102.html|title=People v. Manson|website=Justia Law|language=en|access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman and [[Donald Shea]].

Manson was an unemployed ex-convict who had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions at the time when he began gathering his cult following. Before the murders, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the [[Los Angeles]] music industry, chiefly through a chance association with [[Dennis Wilson]] of [[the Beach Boys]]. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song "Cease to Exist", retitled "[[Never Learn Not to Love]]" as the B-side on one of their singles, but without a credit to Manson.

The Los Angeles district attorney said that Manson was obsessed with [[the Beatles]], particularly their 1968 self-titled album known as [[The Beatles (album)|the "White Album"]]. He claimed to be guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term "[[Helter Skelter (scenario)|Helter Skelter]]" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. At trial, the prosecution claimed that Manson and his followers believed that the murders would help precipitate that war. Other contemporary interviews and those who testified during the penalty phase of Manson's trial insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes designed to exonerate Manson's friend [[Bobby Beausoleil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/manson-murders-motive-copycat.php|title=Manson Murders Motive {{!}} Copycat Motive|website=www.cielodrive.com |access-date=2019-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Day, James Buddy (Director). 2017. ''Charles Manson: The Final Words'' (Documentary). Pyramid Productions.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of Manson's notoriety, a pop culture arose around him and he became an emblem of insanity, violence, and the macabre. Recordings were released commercially of [[Charles Manson discography|songs written and performed by Manson]], starting with ''[[Lie: The Love and Terror Cult]]'' (1970). Various musicians have covered [[List of covers of Charles Manson songs|some of his songs]]. Manson was originally sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. He served his life sentence at [[California State Prison, Corcoran]] and died at age 83 in late 2017.

==1934–1967: Early life ==
=== Childhood ===
Charles Manson was born on November 12, 1934, to 16-year-old Kathleen Manson-Bower-Cavender,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theclever.com/15-lesser-known-facts-about-charles-manson/ |title=15 Lesser-Known Facts About The Late Charles Manson |date=November 21, 2017 |publisher=The Clever |last=Woods|first=Jared |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129074434/https://www.theclever.com/15-lesser-known-facts-about-charles-manson/ |archivedate=November 29, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; née Maddox (1918–1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Manson,Charles.html |title=Internet Accuracy Project: Charles Manson, a website dedicated to providing accurate information on the web |publisher=Accuracyproject.org |access-date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. He was first named "no name Maddox".&lt;ref name="bugliosi"&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Manson|1988|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mom"&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Smith|first=Dave |title=Mother Tells Life of Manson as Boy|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=Jan 26, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within weeks, he was called '''Charles Milles Maddox'''.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reitwiesner, William Addams. [http://www.wargs.com/other/manson.html Provisional ancestry of Charles Manson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010208/http://www.wargs.com/other/manson.html |date=March 5, 2016}}; retrieved April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. (1910–1954)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Manson,Charles.html |title=''Internet Accuracy Project: Charles Manson'' |publisher=Accuracyproject.org |access-date=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]], against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] suit that resulted in an [[stipulated judgment|agreed judgment]] in 1937. Manson may never have known his biological father.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mom" /&gt; Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and also had a local reputation as a [[con artist]]. He allowed Maddox to believe he was an army colonel, although "Colonel" was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott she was pregnant, he told her he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1934, before Manson's birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (1909–1961), whose occupation was listed on Charles's birth certificate as a "laborer" at a dry cleaning business.&lt;ref name="Guinn p.23"&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maddox went on drinking sprees for days at a time with her brother Luther, leaving Charles with a variety of babysitters. They were divorced on April 30, 1937, when a court accepted Manson's charge of "gross neglect of duty".&lt;ref name="Guinn p.23" /&gt;

On August 1, 1939, Maddox and Luther's girlfriend Julia Vickers spent the evening drinking with Frank Martin, a new acquaintance who appeared to be wealthy. Maddox and Vickers decided to rob him, and Maddox phoned her brother to help. They were incompetent thieves, and were found and arrested within hours. At the trial seven weeks later, Luther was sentenced to ten years in prison, and Kathleen was sentenced to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in [[McMechen, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="ketchup"&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/books/a-new-look-at-charles-manson-by-jeff-guinn.html |title = Long Before Little Charlie Became the Face of Evil |date = August 7, 2013 |work = The New York Times |access-date = January 7, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930225705/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/07/books/a-new-look-at-charles-manson-by-jeff-guinn.html |archivedate = September 30, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was paroled in 1942. Manson later characterized the first weeks after she returned from prison as the happiest time in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson's family moved to [[Charleston, West Virginia]], where Manson continually played truant and his mother spent her evenings drinking. She was arrested for [[grand larceny]], but not convicted. After moving to [[Indianapolis]], Maddox started attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings where she met an alcoholic named Lewis (no first name), whom she married in August 1943. 

=== First offenses===
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Manson said that when he was nine years old, he set his school on fire.&lt;ref&gt;"Charles Manson -- Diane Sawyer Documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manson also began to get into trouble with the courts, for truancy and petty theft.  The court initially tried to place Manson in a foster home, but could not find one.  In 1947, at the age of 13, Manson was placed in the [[Gibault School for Boys]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], a school for male delinquents run by Catholic priests. 

Gibault was a strict school, where punishment for even the tiniest infraction included beatings by either a wooden paddle or a leather strap. Manson ran away from Gibault, and slept in the woods, under bridges, and wherever else he could find a place of shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Al Hunter, "Charles Manson -- Hoosier Juvenile Dilenquent," The Weekly View, Jan. 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson fled home to his mother, and spent Christmas 1947 in McMechen, at his aunt and uncle's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|pp=37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother returned him to Gibault.  Ten months later, he ran away to Indianapolis. 

In 1948, in Indianapolis, Manson committed his first known crime by robbing a grocery store. At first the robbery was simply to find something to eat.  However, Manson found a cigar box containing just over a hundred dollars, and he took the money.  He used the money to rent a room on Indianapolis’ Skid Row and to buy food. For a time, Manson tried to go straight by getting a job delivering messages for Western Union.  However, he quickly began to supplement his wages by petty theft.&lt;ref&gt;Al Hunter, "Charles Manson -- Hoosier Juvenile Dilenquent," The Weekly View, Jan. 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was eventually caught, and in 1949, a sympathetic judge sent him to [[Boys Town (organization)|Boys Town]], a juvenile facility in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Manson -- Diane Sawyer Interview.&lt;/ref&gt; After four days at Boys Town, he and a student named Blackie Nielson stole a car and somehow obtained a gun. They used it to rob a grocery store and a casino, as they made their way to the home of Nielson's uncle in [[Peoria, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=136–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielson's uncle was a professional thief, and when the boys arrived he apparently took them on as apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson was arrested two weeks later during a nighttime raid on a Peoria store. In the investigation that followed, he was linked to his two earlier armed robberies. He was sent to the [[Plainfield Juvenile Correctional Facility|Indiana Boys School]], a strict reform school. 

At the school, other students [[raped]] Manson with the encouragement of a staff member, and he was repeatedly beaten.  He ran away from the school eighteen times.&lt;ref&gt;"Charles Manson -- Diane Sawyer Interview.&lt;/ref&gt;  While at the school, Manson developed a self-defense technique he later called the "insane game".  When he was physically unable to defend himself, he would screech, grimace and wave his arms to convince aggressors that he was insane. After a number of failed attempts, he escaped with two other boys in February 1951.&lt;ref name="Guinn p.45"&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bc13746"&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|pp=137–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three escapees were attempting to drive to [[California]] in stolen cars when they were arrested in [[Utah]]. They had robbed several filling stations along the way. Driving a stolen car across state lines is a [[federal crime]] that violates the [[Leonidas C. Dyer#Anti-automobile theft law|Dyer Act]]. Manson was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[National Training School for Boys]].&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; On arrival he was given aptitude tests. He was illiterate, but his [[IQ]] was 109 (the national average was 100). His case worker deemed him aggressively [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]].&lt;ref name="Guinn p.45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

=== First imprisonment ===
On a psychiatrist's recommendation, Manson was transferred in October 1951 to Natural Bridge Honor Camp, a [[minimum security]] institution.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; His aunt visited him and told administrators she would let him stay at her house and would help him find work. Manson had a parole hearing scheduled for February 1952. However, in January, he was caught raping a boy at knifepoint. Manson was transferred to the Federal Reformatory in [[Petersburg, Virginia]]. There he committed a further "eight serious disciplinary offenses, three involving homosexual acts". He was then moved to a [[Incarceration in the United States#Security levels|maximum security]] reformatory at [[Chillicothe, Ohio]], where he was expected to remain until his release on his 21st birthday in November 1955. Good behavior led to an early release in May 1954, to live with his aunt and uncle in McMechen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guinn|2013|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charles Manson mugshot FCI Terminal Island California 1956-05-02 3845-CAL.png|thumb|right|Booking photo, Federal Correctional Institute Terminal Island, May 2, 1956]]

In January 1955, Manson married a hospital waitress named Rosalie Jean Willis.&lt;ref name="emmons"&gt;{{harvnb|Manson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around October, about three months after he and his pregnant wife arrived in [[Los Angeles]] in a car he had stolen in Ohio, Manson was again charged with a federal crime for taking the vehicle across state lines. After a psychiatric evaluation, he was given five years' probation. Manson's failure to appear at a Los Angeles hearing on an identical charge filed in [[Florida]] resulted in his March 1956 arrest in Indianapolis. His probation was revoked; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment at [[Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island|Terminal Island]], [[San Pedro, California]].&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

While Manson was in prison, Rosalie gave birth to their son Charles Manson Jr. During his first year at Terminal Island, Manson received visits from Rosalie and his mother, who were now living together in Los Angeles. In March 1957, when the visits from his wife ceased, his mother informed him Rosalie was living with another man. Less than two weeks before a scheduled parole hearing, Manson tried to escape by stealing a car. He was given five years' probation and his parole was denied.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

=== Second imprisonment ===
Manson received five years' parole in September 1958, the same year in which Rosalie received a decree of divorce. By November, he was pimping a 16-year-old girl and was receiving additional support from a girl with wealthy parents. In September 1959, he pleaded guilty to a charge of attempting to cash a forged [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] check, which he claimed to have stolen from a mailbox; the latter charge was later dropped. He received a 10-year [[suspended sentence]] and probation after a young woman named Leona, who had an arrest record for prostitution, made a "tearful plea" before the court that she and Manson were "deeply in love&amp;nbsp;... and would marry if Charlie were freed".&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; Before the year's end, the woman did marry Manson, possibly so she [[Spousal privilege|would not be required]] to testify against him.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

Manson took Leona and another woman to [[New Mexico]] for purposes of prostitution, resulting in him being held and questioned for violating the [[Mann Act]]. Though he was released, Manson correctly suspected that the investigation had not ended. When he disappeared in violation of his probation, a [[Arrest warrant#Bench warrant|bench warrant]] was issued. An [[indictment]] for violation of the Mann Act followed in April 1960.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; When one of the women was arrested for prostitution, Manson was arrested in June in [[Laredo, Texas]], and was returned to Los Angeles. For violating his probation on the check-cashing charge, he was ordered to serve his ten year sentence.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

Manson spent a year trying unsuccessfully to appeal the revocation of his probation. In July 1961, he was transferred from the Los Angeles County Jail to the United States Penitentiary at [[McNeil Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. There, he took guitar lessons from [[Barker–Karpis gang]] leader [[Alvin Karpis#Imprisonment|Alvin "Creepy" Karpis]], and obtained from another inmate a contact name of someone at [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]], [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=July 2, 2012 |url=http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |work=Lost in the Grooves |title=Short Bits 2 – Charles Manson and the Beach Boys |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718010206/http://www.lostinthegrooves.com/short-bits-2-charles-manson-and-the-beach-boys |archivedate=July 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all |date=April 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jeff Guinn's 2013 biography of Manson, his mother moved to Washington State to be closer to him during his McNeil Island incarceration, working nearby as a waitress.&lt;ref name="Rule/Guinn"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rule |first=Ann |title=There Will Be Blood |journal=The New York Times Book Review |date=August 18, 2013 |page=14 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Mann Act charge had been dropped, the attempt to cash the Treasury check was still a federal offense. Manson's September 1961 annual review noted he had a "tremendous drive to call attention to himself", an observation echoed in September 1964.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; In 1963, Leona was granted a divorce. During the process she alleged that she and Manson had a son, Charles Luther.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; According to a popular urban legend, Manson auditioned unsuccessfully for [[the Monkees]] in late 1965; this is refuted by the fact that Manson was still incarcerated at McNeil Island at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/radiotv/tv/monkees.asp |title=Did Charles Manson Audition for The Monkees? |website=snopes.com |access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1966, Manson was sent for the second time to Terminal Island in preparation for early release. By the time of his release day on March 21, 1967, he had spent more than half of his 32 years in prisons and other institutions. This was mainly because he had broken federal laws. Federal sentences were, and remain, much more severe than state sentences for many of the same offenses.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt; Telling the authorities that prison had become his home, he requested permission to stay.&lt;ref name="bc13746" /&gt;

=== Cult formation ===
Once discharged from prison, Manson began attracting a group of followers, mostly young women, from around California. They were later dubbed the [[Manson Family]]. 

The core members of Manson's following included Charles 'Tex' Watson, a musician and former actor; former musician and [[pornographic actor]], Robert Beausoleil; [[Mary Brunner]], previously a librarian; [[Susan Atkins]]; [[Linda Kasabian]]; [[Patricia Krenwinkel]]; and [[Leslie Van Houten]].&lt;ref name="InsideFamily"&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles Manson's Son Says He Wishes He'd Gotten to Know Him Before His Death |url=https://www.insideedition.com/charles-mansons-son-says-he-wishes-hed-gotten-know-him-his-death-54566 |website=insideedition.com |publisher=Inside Edition Inc, CBS Interactive |accessdate=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ViceBob"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kovac |first1=Adam |title=We Spoke to Charles Manson's Guitarist About Making Art While Serving Time for Murder |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bn5wwd/we-spoke-to-charles-mansons-guitarist-about-his-life-making-art-and-music-while-serving-time-for-murder-298 |website=vice.com |publisher=Vice Media |accessdate=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Milne |first1=Andrew |title=Meet Bobby Beausoleil: The Haight-Ashbury Hippie Who Became A Manson Family Murderer |url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/bobby-beausoleil |website=allthatsinteresting.com |publisher=PBH Network |accessdate=24 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murders ===

During the summer of 1969, Manson told his followers that there would soon be a race war between America's black population and the larger white population. Manson referred to the upcoming war as "Helter Skelter."

In early August 1969, Manson encouraged his followers to start Helter Skelter, by committing murders in the Los Angeles area, and making the killings appear to be racially motivated.  The Manson Family gained national notoriety after the [[Tate murders|murder of actress Sharon Tate]] and four others in her home on August 8 and 9, 1969,&lt;ref name="KXTV family"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Renee |first1=Alexa |title=The Manson family: Who are they and where are they now? |url=http://www.abc10.com/news/local/the-manson-family-who-are-they-and-where-are-they-now/423180658 |access-date=November 5, 2017 |publisher=KXTV |date=November 2, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331113904/http://www.abc10.com/news/local/the-manson-family-who-are-they-and-where-are-they-now/423180658 |archivedate=March 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the next day.

This was due to the fact that that his ideology of catalyzing a [[Ethnic conflict|race war]] by killing those he saw as "pigs" was "a fundamental part of life" for those involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Family members were also responsible for other assaults, thefts, crimes, and the [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|attempted assassination]] of United States President [[Gerald Ford]] in Sacramento by [[Lynette Fromme|Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]].&lt;ref name="Gerald Ford"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schmidt |first1=Dick |title='Pure luck' led to famous photo of would-be President Ford assassin |url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/history/article171154912.html |access-date=November 5, 2017 |work=The Sacramento Bee |date=September 5, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905170515/http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/history/article171154912.html |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is often thought that Manson never murdered or attempted to murder anyone himself, there is evidence{{elucidate|date=November 2019}} that he shot drug dealer Bernard Crowe and left him for dead on July 1, 1969, although Crowe survived.&lt;ref name="bugliosi" /&gt;{{rp|91–96, 99–113}}

=== Trial ===

The State of California tried Manson for the Tate and LaBianca murders in a single trial, with co-defendants, [[Leslie Van Houten]], [[Susan Atkins]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel]].  Co-defendant, [[Tex Watson]] would be tried at a later date because he had not yet been extradited from Texas.

The trial began on July 15, 1970.  Manson showed up wearing fringed buckskins, his typical clothing at Spahn Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Deutch, "'This is crazy’: Former AP reporter remembers Manson trial," AP, Nov. 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three female co-defendants wore short skirts.  

On July 24, 1970 -- the first day of testimony -- Manson appeared in court with an "X" carved into his forehead. His followers issued a statement from Manson saying "I have "X'd myself from your world."&lt;ref name="imprint"&gt;{{cite web |last1=La Ganga |first1=Maria L. |last2=Himmelsbach-Weinstein |first2=Erik |title=Charles Manson's murderous imprint on L.A. endures as other killers have come and gone |url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-27/charles-manson-family-murders-50-years-later |website=latimes.com |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |date=July 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, Manson's co-defendants, Van Houten, Atkins, and Krenwinkel, also appeared in court, with an "X" carved in their foreheads.  

During the trial, Manson and his co-defendants repeatedly interrupted the testimony and mocked the proceedings.  All of the defendants were repeatedly removed from the trial, and forced to listen to testimony from other rooms in the courthouse.

Members of the [[Manson Family]] camped outside of the courthouse, and held a vigil on a street corner, because they had been excluded from the courtroom for being disruptive.  Some of Manson's followers also carved crosses into their heads.&lt;ref name="imprint"/&gt;  One day, members of the [[Manson Family]] showed up in saffron robes, and threatened to immolate themselves if Manson was convicted -- just as nuns in Vietnam had done in protest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Deutch, "'This is crazy’: Former AP reporter remembers Manson trial," AP, Nov. 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manson would later alter the X into a [[swastika]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Osborne |first1=Samuel |title=Charles Manson: Who was the infamous cult leader and what did he do? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/charles-manson-serial-killer-cult-leader-family-crimes-victims-dead-death-sharon-tate-prisoner-a8064721.html |website=independent.co.uk |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=November 1, 2019 |date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;     

The State presented dozens of witnesses during the trial.  However, its primary witness was [[Linda Kasabian]], who was present during the Tate murders on August 8-9, 1969.  Kasabian provided graphic testimony of the Tate murders, which she observed from outside the house.  She was also in the car with Manson on the following evening, when he ordered the LaBianca killings. 
Kasabian spent days on the witness stand, being cross-examined by the defendants' lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders.  After testifying, Kasabian went into hiding for the next forty years.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early August 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] told reporters that he believed that Manson was guilty of the murders, "either directly or indirectly."&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Rosenwald, "How Charles Manson almost won a mistrial, courtesy of Richard Nixon," ''Washington Post'', Aug. 8, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;  Manson obtained a newspaper showing the headline, and held it up to the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders.&lt;/ref&gt;  The defendants' attorneys then moved for a mistrial, claiming that their clients had allegedly killed far fewer people than "Nixon's war machine in Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Rosenwald, "How Charles Manson almost won a mistrial, courtesy of Richard Nixon," ''Washington Post'', Aug. 8, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge [[Charles H. Older]] polled each member of the jury separately, to determine whether each juror was able to see the headline, and whether it affected his or her ability to make an independent decision in the case.  All of the jurors told the judge that they could still decide independently.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the three female defendants -- Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten -- stood up in the middle of the trial and simultaneously chanted, "Nixon says we are guilty.  So why go on?"  Judge Older had the defendants removed from the room.&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosk, Helter Skelter.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 1970, Manson attempted to kill Judge Older while the jury was present in the room.  Manson first threatened Judge Older, and then jumped over his lawyer's table with a sharpened pencil, in the direction of Judge Older.  Manson was restrained before he was able to reach the judge.  While he was being led out of the courtroom, Manson screamed at Judge Older, "In the name of Christian justice, someone should cut your head off!"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 485-87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the female defendants -- Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten -- stood up and began chanting something in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 486.&lt;/ref&gt;  Judge Older began wearing a .38 caliber pistol to the trial afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 1970, the State of California rested its case after presenting twenty-two weeks of evidence.  The defendants then stunned the courtroom by announcing that they had no witnesses to present, and rested their case.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 503-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manson's testimony ===

Immediately after defendants' counsel rested their case, the three female defendants, Van Houten, Krenwinkel and Atkins shouted that they wanted to testify.  Their attorneys advised the court, in chambers, that they opposed their clients testifying.  Apparently, the female defendants wanted to testify and tell the court that Manson had had nothing to do with the murders.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Manson himself announced that he too wanted to testify.  The judge allowed Manson to testify outside the presence of the jury.  He stated as follows:  {{quote|These children that come at you with knives, they are your children.  You taught them.  I didn't teach them.  I just tried to help them stand up.  Most of the people at the ranch that you call the Family were just people that you did not want.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 507.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Manson continued, equating his actions to those of society at large: {{quote|I know this:  that in your hearts and your souls, you are as much responsible for the Vietnam war as I am for killing these people. . . .  I can't judge any of you. I have no malice against you and no ribbons for you. But I think that it is high time that you all start looking at yourselves, and judging the lie that you live in.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 509-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Manson concluded, claiming that he too was a creation of a system that he viewed as fundamentally violent and unjust: {{quote|My father is the jailhouse.  My father is your system. . . . I am only what you made me.  I am only a reflection of you. . . .  You want to kill me?  Ha!  I am already dead -- have been all my life.  I've spent twenty-three years in tombs that you have built.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 509-10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  After Manson finished speaking, Judge Older offered to let him testify before the jury.  Manson replied that it was not necessary.  Manson then told the female defendants that they no longer needed to testify.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 514.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On November 30, 1970, Leslie Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes, failed to appear for the closing arguments in the trial.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 514.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was later found dead in a California state park. His body was badly decomposed, and it was impossible to tell the cause of death.  Hughes had disagreed with Manson during the trial, taking the position that his client, Van Houten, should not testify to claim that Manson had no involvement with the murders.  As a result, many have claimed that Hughes may have been murdered by the Manson Family.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 595.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On January 25, 1971, the jury found Manson, Krenwinkel and Atkins guilty of first degree murder in all seven of the Tate and LaBianca killings.  The jury found Van Houten guilty of murder in the first degree in the LaBianca killings.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 537-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sentencing phase of trial ===

After the convictions, the court held a separate hearing before the same jury to determine whether the defendants should be sentenced to death.  

During the penalty phase of the trial, each of the three female defendants, Atkins, Van Houten, and Krenwinkel, took the stand.  They provided graphic details of the murders and testified that Manson was not involved.  According to the female defendants, they had committed the crimes in order to help fellow Manson Family member [[Bobby Beausoleil]] get out of jail, where he was being held for the murder of [[Gary Hinman]].  The female defendants testified that the Tate-LaBianca murders were intended to be "copycat" crimes, similar to the Hinman killing.  Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten claimed they did this at the direction of the state's prime witness, [[Linda Kasabian]].&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Bugliosi &amp; Curt Gentry, Helter Skelter:  The True Story of the Manson Murders, at 560-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

During their testimony, none of these defendants expressed remorse for the killings in response to questions from their own attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 560-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 1971, in the middle of the sentencing phase of the trial, Manson trimmed his beard to a fork and shaved his head, telling the media, "I am the Devil, and the Devil always has a bald head!"  However, this time, the female defendants did not immediately shave their own heads.  The prosecutor, Vincent Bugliosi, later speculated in his book, ''Helter Skelter'', that they refrained from doing so, in order to not appear to be completely controlled by Manson (as they had when they each carved an "X" in their foreheads, earlier in the trial).&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 571-72.&lt;/ref&gt;     

On March 29, 1971, the jury announced that it had reached a decision with respect to the death penalty.  When the women defendants were led into the courtroom for the decision, each of the women had also shaved their heads, as had Manson.  The jury then announced its decision to sentence all four defendants to death.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 592-93.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before leaving the courtroom, defendant Atkins shouted to the jury, "Better lock your doors and watch your kids."&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 593.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manson murder trial was the longest murder trial in American history when it occurred, lasting nine and a half months.  Along with the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson case during the 1990s, the case was the most publicized American criminal case of the twentieth century.  The jury had been sequestered for 225 days, longer than any jury before it.  The trial transcript alone ran to 209 volumes, or 31,716 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Id., at 594.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1971–2017: Third imprisonment ==
=== Post-trial events ===
Manson was admitted to state prison from Los Angeles County on April 22, 1971, for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski, Jay Sebring, and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. 

When the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in 1972, Manson was resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. His original death sentence was modified to life on February 2, 1977.

On December 13, 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Court for the July 25, 1969 death of musician Gary Hinman. He was also convicted of first-degree murder for the August 1969 death of Donald Jerome "Shorty" Shea. A footnote to the conclusion of ''[[People v. Anderson|California v. Anderson]]'', the 1972 decision that neutralized California's death sentences, stated that, "any prisoner now under a sentence of death ... may file a petition for writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in the superior court inviting that court to modify its judgment to provide for the appropriate alternative punishment of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without possibility of parole specified by statute for the crime for which he was sentenced to death."&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/6C3d628.htm ''People v.

In the 1980s, Manson gave four interviews to the mainstream media. The first, recorded at [[California Medical Facility]] and aired on June 13, 1981 was by [[Tom Snyder]] for [[NBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow Coast to Coast|The Tomorrow Show]]''. The second, recorded at [[San Quentin State Prison]] and aired on March 7, 1986 was by [[Charlie Rose]] for ''CBS News Nightwatch'', and it won the national news [[Emmy Award]] for Best Interview in 1987.&lt;ref name="Diary of a Mad Saloon Owner"&gt;Joynt, Carol.

[[Nikolas Schreck]] conducted an interview with Manson for his documentary ''[[Charles Manson Superstar]]'' (1989). Schreck concluded that Manson was not insane but merely acting that way out of frustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Charles Manson Superstar|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|work=Interano Radio|title=Interview with Nikolas Schreck|date=August 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 1984, Manson was imprisoned in the [[California Medical Facility]] at [[Vacaville, California|Vacaville]] when inmate Jan Holmstrom poured [[paint thinner]] on him and set him on fire, causing second- and third-degree burns on over 20&amp;nbsp;percent of his body. Holmstrom explained that Manson had objected to his [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] chants and verbally threatened him.&lt;ref name="bc497"&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, Manson was housed in the Protective Housing Unit at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County. The unit houses inmates whose safety would be endangered by general population housing. He had also been housed at San Quentin State Prison,&lt;ref name="Diary of a Mad Saloon Owner" /&gt; California Medical Facility in Vacaville,&lt;ref name="bc497" /&gt; Folsom State Prison and Pelican Bay State Prison.&lt;ref name="Sun Journal" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2017|reason=Still need cite for Folsom State Prison}}

On September 5, 2007, [[MSNBC]] aired ''The Mind of Manson'', a complete version of a 1987 interview at California's [[San Quentin State Prison]]. The footage of the "unshackled, unapologetic, and unruly" Manson had been considered "so unbelievable" that only seven minutes of it had originally been broadcast on ''[[Today (American TV program)|Today]]'', for which it had been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20623572 ''MSNBC Live''] .

In March 2009, a photograph of Manson showing a receding hairline, grizzled gray beard and hair, and the swastika tattoo still prominent on his forehead was released to the public by California corrections officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New prison photo of Charles Manson released |publisher=CNN |date=March 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/19/california.manson.photo/index.html |access-date=July 21, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729031627/http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/19/california.manson.photo/index.html |archivedate=July 29, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Manson was caught with a cell phone in 2009 and had contacted people in California, New Jersey, Florida and British Columbia.

In July 1961, Manson claimed his religion was [[Scientology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bugliosi|Gentry|1974|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and identified as a Scientologist after studying the religion while incarcerated with the help of fellow inmate Lanier Rayner; however, he was not a member of the [[Church of Scientology]].&lt;ref name="mallia1998"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Mallia |first=Joseph |title=Inside the Church of Scientology&amp;nbsp;– Church wields celebrity clout |work=[[Boston Herald]] |page=30 |date=March 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Steven V. |last=Roberts |title=Charlie Manson, Nomadic Guru, Flirted With Crime in a Turbulent Childhood |work=[[New York Times]] |page=84 |date=7 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goodsell |first=Greg |title=Manson once proclaimed Scientology |work=Catholic Online |publisher=www.catholic.org |date=February 23, 2010 |url=http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=35505 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227053826/http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=35505 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 27, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson completed 150 hours of [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] before declaring Scientology "too crazy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/cooper/scandal_behind_scandal.html|title=The Scandal Behind the "Scandal of Scientology"|last=Cooper|first=Paulette|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu|access-date=2019-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships and alleged child ===
In 2009, Los Angeles disk jockey Matthew Roberts released correspondence and other evidence indicating that he might be Manson's biological son. Roberts' biological mother claims that she was a member of the Manson Family who left in mid-1967 after being raped by Manson; she returned to her parents' home to complete the pregnancy, gave birth on March 22, 1968, and put Roberts up for adoption. CNN conducted a DNA test between Matthew Roberts and Manson's known biological grandson Jason Freeman in 2012, showing that Roberts and Freeman did not share DNA.&lt;ref name="specter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2012/04/23/us/ohio-manson-grandson/index.html|title=Two men relate to same haunting specter – Charles Manson|last=Marquez|first=Miguel|publisher=CNN|date=April 24, 2012|access-date=2019-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts subsequently attempted to establish that Manson was his father through a direct DNA test which proved definitively that Roberts and Manson were not related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/charles-mansons-body-is-on-ice-under-a-fake-name-10|title=The Battle Over Charles Manson's Corpse|first=Kate|last=Briquelet|date=March 8, 2018|website=Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton said on her website that the reason that the marriage did not take place was merely logistical. Manson was suffering from an infection and had been in a prison medical facility for two months and could not receive visitors. She said that she still hoped that the marriage license would be renewed and the marriage would take place.&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

=== Psychology ===

On April 11, 2012, Manson was denied release at his 12th parole hearing, which he did not attend. After his March 27, 1997 parole hearing, Manson refused to attend any of his later hearings. The panel at that hearing noted that Manson had a "history of [[Abusive power and control|controlling behavior]]" and "mental health issues" including schizophrenia and [[Paranoia#Paranoid social cognition|paranoid delusional disorder]], and was too great a danger to be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/charles-manson-quickly-denied-parole.html |title=Charles Manson Quickly Denied Parole |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=April 11, 2012 |access-date=April 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411181326/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/charles-manson-quickly-denied-parole.html |archivedate=April 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel also noted that Manson had received 108 rules violation reports, had no indication of remorse, no insight into the causative factors of the crimes, lacked understanding of the magnitude of the crimes, had an exceptional, callous disregard for human suffering and had no parole plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cielodrive.com/charles-manson-parole-hearing-2012.php |title=Parole Hearing: Charles Manson 2012|website=cielodrive.com |access-date=November 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the April 11, 2012, parole hearing, it was determined that Manson would not be reconsidered for parole for another 15 years, i.e. not before 2027, at which time he would have been 92 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Kiki |url=http://www.kionrightnow.com/story/17385763/charles-manson-denied-parole |title=Murderer Charles Manson Denied Parole – Central Coast News KION/KCBA |publisher=Kionrightnow.com |date=April 11, 2012 |access-date=August 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413172109/http://www.kionrightnow.com/story/17385763/charles-manson-denied-parole |archivedate=April 13, 2012 }}{{cite web |url=http://www.pressherald.com/2012/04/11/manson-skips-12th-parole-hearing-may-be-his-last/ |title=Mass murderer Charles Manson denied parole |access-date=November 18, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118190205/http://www.pressherald.com/2012/04/11/manson-skips-12th-parole-hearing-may-be-his-last/ |archivedate=November 18, 2015 |df=mdy-all |date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson was a struggling musician, seeking to make it big in Hollywood between 1967 and 1969.  The [[Beach Boys]] did a cover of one of his songs.  Other songs were publicly released only after the trial for the Tate murders started.

Convicted of three murders, she was imprisoned for 16 years before being sent to an elderly care facility to serve out the remainder of her sentence, due to her advanced age.

== Murders ==
Nilda Gamba, a neighbor of Murano's died on 10 February 1979. On 19 February, Murano's friend, Leila Chicha Formisano de Ayala, died. Murano owed money to both women, and both bodies showed signs of [[cyanide poisoning]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

On 24 March 1979, Murano's cousin, Carmen Zulema del Giorgio de Venturini, fell and died on the stairs of a building on Hipólito Yrigoyen Street, where she lived.  Zulema's death was initially attributed to [[cardiac arrest]]. Zulema's daughter found that a promissory note worth 20 million [[Argentine peso ley]] was missing from her mother's belongings. The building's doorman said that Murano arrived for a visit carrying a mysterious package (which was later discovered to contain ''[[Petit four|masas finas]])'', and had casually asked for a copy of the keys to Zulema's apartment keys, saying, "I need her notebook to warn her relatives".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emujer.com/mujer-envenenadora-yiya-murano/ |title=Mujer envenenadora: Yiya Murano |date=2007-06-23 |website=eMujer.com |language=es |access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Murano entered her cousin's apartment and left quickly, carrying papers and a jar. She complained loudly: "My God, it's my third friend to die in a short time!" During the autopsy, examiners discovered cyanide in Zulema's body. Investigators discovered the poison in the jar mentioned by the doorman, and in the ''masas finas''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Arrest ==
On 27 April 1979, the police arrested Murano at her home on Mexico Street. In 1980, she was found unconscious in the prison where she was being held; later, they removed one of Murano's lungs.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Murano was convicted in 1985, during the [[Trial of the Juntas]]. She insisted upon her innocence, saying: "I never invited anyone to eat."{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Murano was released from prison after 16 years. It was learned that she sent the judges who released her a box of chocolates as a token of her appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/06/28/policiales/g-04002.htm |title=Hace veinte años condenaban a la "envenenadora de Monserrat" |date=2005-06-28 |newspaper=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |language=es |access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Argentinian writer [[Marisa Grinstein]] included Murano in her book ''Mujeres Asesinas (Killer Women).'' In 2006'','' an episode of the [[Canal 13 (Argentina)|Canal 13]] [[Mujeres Asesinas (Argentine TV series)|television series of the same name]] featured a recreation of Murano's crimes.

'''William MacDonald''' (17 June 1924&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 2015) was an English [[serial killer]] responsible for the deaths of five people in the Australian states of Queensland and New South Wales between 1961 and 1962.

MacDonald was born in [[Liverpool]], England in 1924.&lt;ref name="Kidd"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/macdonald/monster_2.html | title = William "The Mutilator" Macdonald: The Making of a Monster | accessdate =28 October 2010 | last = Kidd | first = Paul B. | date = 2010 | work=William "The Mutilator" Macdonald | publisher= Turner Entertainment Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1961 and 1962, MacDonald terrorised [[Sydney]] with a string of gruesome murders before being apprehended while working as a porter at Melbourne's [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street railway station]] on 13 May 1963.&lt;ref name=impulses&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G0YVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6986,1244522&amp;dq Mutilation Killings Result of Strange Impulses, Court Told] ''[[The Age]]'', 9 August 1963, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His modus operandi was to select his male victims at random (mostly derelicts), lure them into a dark place, violently punch and stab them with a long bladed knife dozens of times about the head and neck, and finally sever their genitals. Due to his gruesome style of murdering victims, he was given the nickname "the Mutilator" by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/the-mutilator-dead-at-90-william-macdonald-who-cut-off-victims-genitalia-was-nsws-longest-serving-prisoner/story-fnmd7bxx-1227353530066?nk=f42cf35084d808374e77b6664c7d384d-1584677063|title=The Mutilator serial killer who first struck in Brisbane|date=2015-05-13|website=www.couriermail.com.au|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
MacDonald was born Allen Ginsberg in [[Liverpool|Liverpool, England]], in 1924.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=da_fY9EfydsC|title=The Serial Killer Files: The Who, What, Where, How, and Why of the World's Most Terrifying Murderers|last=Schechter|first=Harold|date=2003-12-30|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780345472007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, at the age of 19, MacDonald was enlisted in the army and transferred to the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]]. One night, MacDonald was [[rape]]d in an [[air-raid shelter]] by one of his [[corporal]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The experience traumatised him, and the thought preyed on his mind for the rest of his life. Discharged from the army in 1947, he was diagnosed as having [[schizophrenia]] and committed for several months to a [[History of psychiatric institutions|mental asylum]] where daily he was treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name="Kidd" /&gt;

MacDonald changed his name, then emigrated from England to Canada in 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/murder-spree-ended-when-mutilator-rose-from-dead/news-story/8eff2eff473f1086ca49c287fdfe2577|title=Murder spree ended when Mutilator ‘rose from dead’|date=2015-05-13|website=www.dailytelegraph.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then to Australia in 1955. Shortly after his arrival, he was arrested and charged for touching a detective's penis in a public toilet in Adelaide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stitcher.com/s?eid=48111932|title=Felon - S1E11 - The Sydney Mutilator from Felon True Crime|website=www.stitcher.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this he was placed on a two-year good behavior bond. After moving to Ballarat, MacDonald then moved to Sydney in 1961 as a construction worker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He found accommodation in [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]], where he became well known in the parks and public toilets that were surreptitious meeting places for homosexual men, due to [[LGBT rights in Australia|the criminalisation of same-sex sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Crimes ==
===First victim===
The murders began in [[Brisbane]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; MacDonald befriended a 63-year-old man named Amos Hugh Hurst&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article109898550|title=New Inquiry Into Death Indecisive|date=1963-07-19|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside the Roma Street Railway Station. After a long drinking session at one of the local pubs, they went back to Hurst's apartment where they consumed more alcohol. When Hurst became intoxicated MacDonald began to strangle him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hurst was so intoxicated that he did not realise what was happening and eventually began to [[Bleeding|haemorrhage]]. Blood poured from his mouth and on to MacDonald's hands. MacDonald then punched Hurst in the face, killing him. MacDonald then placed Hurst onto his bed, took off his trousers and shoes and pulled the sheets up over Hurst's head and tucked them in around all sides. MacDonald then waited there a while then turned off the lights and left the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104280535|title=&amp;#39;Compulsion To Kill&amp;#39; Alleged At Inquest|date=1963-12-05|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five days later, he found Hurst's name in a newspaper obituary column. It said Hurst had died accidentally. MacDonald, surprised, had been in terror of the police arresting him for murder, even though he was certain that no one had seen him leave Hurst's room.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===Second victim===
On 4 June 1961, police were summoned to the [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney Domain]] [[Andrew "Boy" Charlton Pool|Baths]]. A man's nude corpse had been found, savagely stabbed over 30 times, and with the genitalia completely severed from his body. Alfred Reginald Greenfield became the second victim claimed by the killer soon to be dubbed "the Mutilator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105853099|title=WOMAN MURDER SUSPECT|date=1961-11-22|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenfield, 41,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianroyalty.net.au/individual.php?pid=I55606&amp;ged=purnellmccord.ged|title=Alfred Reginald Greenfield 1920–1961 - Australian Royalty: A family tree of colonial Australians, their forbears and descendants|website=australianroyalty.net.au|access-date=2019-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; had been sitting on a park bench in Green Park, just across the road from [[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital]] in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]. MacDonald offered Greenfield a drink and lured him to the nearby Domain Baths on the pretext of providing more alcohol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MacDonald waited until Greenfield fell asleep, then removed his knife from its sheath and stabbed him approximately 30 times. The ferocity of the first blow severed the [[Artery|arteries]] in Greenfield's neck. MacDonald then pulled down Greenfield's trousers and underwear, severed his genitals, put them in a plastic bag and threw them into Sydney Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article131733133|title=Trial Ordered On 4 Deaths|date=1963-08-15|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third victim===
Similar to the second victim, Ernest William Cobbin, a 47-year-old male (possibly 36 or 37 years old) was stabbed repeatedly and mutilated. His body was found in a [[public toilet]] at [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article105853099|title=WOMAN MURDER SUSPECT|date=1961-11-22|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104304544|title=Police Get Description Of Mutilation Killer|date=1962-04-16|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article104303317|title=MURDERER SCARES DERELICTS|date=1962-04-04|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this night, MacDonald was walking down South Dowling Street where he met Cobbin. MacDonald lured his victim to Moore Park and drank beer with him in a public toilet. Just before the attack, MacDonald put on his plastic raincoat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cobbin was sitting on the toilet seat when MacDonald, using an [[uppercut]] motion, struck Cobbin in the neck with a knife, severing his [[jugular vein]]. Blood splattered all over MacDonald's arms, face and his plastic raincoat. Cobbin tried to defend himself by raising his arms. MacDonald continued to stab his victim multiple times, covering the toilet cubicle with blood. MacDonald then severed the victim's genitals, placed them into a plastic bag along with his knife, and departed the scene. On the way home MacDonald washed the blood off his hands and face.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

===Fourth victim===
On 31 March 1962, in suburban [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales]], the mortally wounded Frank Gladstone McLean was found by a man walking with his wife and young child. He was the victim of an unfinished assault committed by MacDonald. The man found McLean still breathing, but bleeding heavily, and went to get police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On this day MacDonald bought a knife from a sports store in Sydney. That night MacDonald left the Oxford Hotel in Darlinghurst and followed McLean down Bourke Street past the local police station. MacDonald initiated conversation with McLean and suggested they have a drinking session around the corner in Bourke Lane. As they entered Bourke Lane, MacDonald plunged his knife into McLean's throat. McLean tried to fight off the attack but he was too intoxicated to do so. He was then stabbed again in the face and punched—forcing him off balance. The assault was interrupted by a young family approaching. MacDonald hid himself on hearing the voices and the sound of a baby's cry. Once the man and his family had left, MacDonald returned to the barely-alive McLean, pulled him further into the lane and stabbed him again. A total of six stab wounds were inflicted.&lt;ref name=firstcom/&gt; He then pulled down McLean's trousers, sliced off his genitals and put them into a plastic bag which he took home and disposed of the next day.

The police at one stage thought that the killer could have been a deranged surgeon. The manner in which McLean's genitals were removed seemed to be done by someone with years of surgical experience. Doctors at one stage found themselves under investigation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

=== Fifth victim ===
After being dismissed from his job at the local post office, where he had been hired as a letter sorter under the assumed name of Alan Edward Brennan, MacDonald went into business for himself. He purchased a mixed business store on Burwood Road in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]], again under the assumed name of Brennan. Here, he intended to sell sandwiches and smallgoods, living in rooms above the store. He actually lived there for only about a week after paying the purchase deposit.&lt;ref name=impulses/&gt;

On the night of Saturday 6 June 1962, MacDonald went to a wine saloon in Pitt Street, Sydney, where he met 37-year-old Patrick Joseph Hackett,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article109898474|title=Coroner Finds Body In Shop Was Hackews|date=1963-07-18|work=Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995)|access-date=2019-06-01|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; a thief and derelict who had just recently been released from prison. They went back to MacDonald's new residence where they continued to drink alcohol. After a short period, Hackett fell asleep on the floor. MacDonald then got out a boning knife that he used in his delicatessen. He stabbed Hackett in the neck, the blow passing straight through. After the first blow, Hackett woke up and tried to shield himself, pushing the knife back into MacDonald's other hand and cutting it severely.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; MacDonald then unleashed a renewed attack, eventually striking the knife into Hackett's heart, killing him instantly. He continued to stab his victim until he had to stop for breath. Hackett's blood was splattered all over the walls and floor.

The knife having become blunted, MacDonald was unable to sever his victim's genitals and fell asleep. When he awoke the following morning he found himself lying next to the victim's body covered in sticky, drying blood. The pools of blood had soaked through the floorboards and almost on to the counter in his shop downstairs. He cleaned himself and went to a hospital to have the wound in his hand stitched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He told the doctor that he had cut himself in his shop. After cleaning up the blood, MacDonald dragged Hackett's corpse underneath his shop. Believing the police would soon come looking for his victim, he fled to Brisbane.

Three weeks later, neighbours noticed a putrid smell coming from the shop and called the health department, which in turn called the police.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On 20 November 1962&lt;ref name=firstcom/&gt; police discovered the rotting corpse, which was too badly decomposed to be identified. An autopsy determined that the body was of someone in their forties, which tallied with records of the missing shop owner, Brennan (MacDonald's alias). In late July, the police had still made no connection between the case and the three previous Mutilator killings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qH1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vOUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6814,6187726&amp;dq Mutilator may be eyeing victim: 4th knife attack due soon] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 22 July 1962, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and had profiled the killer as operating in Sydney's inner eastern suburbs, which were many miles distant from Concord.

===The "Case of the walking corpse"===
After investigations, the victim was incorrectly identified as Brennan and a notice published in a newspaper obituary column. This was read by his former workmates at the local post office, who attended a small memorial service conducted by a local funeral director. At this time, MacDonald was living in Brisbane and then moved to [[New Zealand]], believing that the police would still be looking for him. He felt the need to kill again, but for some reason he had to return to Sydney to do it. Returning to Sydney, he met former workmate John McCarthy, who said, "I believed you had died," at which MacDonald replied, "Leave me alone," and ran away,&lt;ref name=firstcom&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HkYVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5802,1861626&amp;dq For Trial on First of 4 Murder Counts] ''[[The Age]]'', 13 August 1963, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; travelling to [[Melbourne]] soon after.

McCarthy went straight to the police. At first they did not believe him and accused him of having had too much to drink and he was told to go home and sleep it off.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They even said that he was crazy. He went back again the next day and tried to explain what had happened, but they still didn't believe him. This persuaded McCarthy to go to the ''[[The Daily Mirror (Sydney)|Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper where he spoke to crime reporter Joe Morris. McCarthy explained how he bumped into the "supposed to be dead" Brennan. The reporter saw the account as credible and filed a story under the headline "Case of the walking corpse".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Publication forced the police to exhume the corpse. The fingerprints identified the body as belonging to Hackett and not MacDonald. Closer examination found that the body had several stab wounds and mutilation of the penis and testicles, potentially linking the crime to the notorious Mutilator.

==Capture, trial and sentencing==
The Sydney police obtained an [[identikit]] picture of MacDonald, which was circulated to every newspaper in the nation. MacDonald had taken a job on the Melbourne railways, being hired as "David Allan".&lt;ref name="crimezzz"&gt;[http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/M/MacDONALD_william.php McDonald William: Sydney Mutilator] at Serial Killer Crime Index (www.crimezzz.net)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he tried to disguise himself by dyeing his hair and growing a moustache, he was instantly recognised by his workmates. Melbourne police arrested him as he collected his pay for that week.

Under questioning, MacDonald readily admitted to the killings, blaming them on an irresistible urge to kill. He claimed he was the victim of rape as a teenager, and had to disempower the [[Victimology#Victim of a crime|victim]]s chosen at random. A man with schizophrenia, MacDonald said that he heard voices in his head telling him that his victims were the corporal who raped him as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/william-the-mutilator-macdonald-nsws-oldest-prisoner-dead-at-90-20150513-ggzr52.html|title=William 'the Mutilator' Macdonald, NSW's oldest prisoner, dead at 90|date=13 May 2015|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with four counts of murder and committed for trial on 15 August 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yH1VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rJYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5579,2195341&amp;dq Committed on four charges of murder] [[The Age]] p. 5, 15 August 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The trial began in September 1963 and was one of the nation's most sensational. MacDonald pleaded not guilty on the grounds of insanity and testified in great detail to the gruesome murders. He told the court of how blood had sprayed over his raincoat as he castrated his victims, put their private parts into plastic bags and took them home. He even told the court what he did with the genitals once he got home. Some jurors fainted and had to be taken from the court. The jury chose to ignore overwhelming evidence for insanity in handing down a 'guilty' verdict, which amazed expert psychiatrists.&lt;ref name=appeal&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ATVVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=E5UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4647,4123349&amp;d Appeal on Sydney Murder Verdict] ''[[The Age]]'', 26 September 1963, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Before passing sentence, Justice McLennan said that this was the most barbaric case of murder and total disregard for human life that had come before him in his many years on the bench. MacDonald showed no signs of remorse and made it quite clear that, if he were free, he would go on killing. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences with the strong recommendation that he never be released.

== Imprisonment ==
MacDonald was imprisoned at [[Long Bay Correctional Centre#Current divisions|Long Bay Hospital]], a division of Long Bay Correctional Centre, but was soon certified as insane and transferred to a secure mental hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vwdFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6066,6481744&amp;dq Mutilator certified insane: Minister advised] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 26 January 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison system, MacDonald was known simply as Bill; he had been in prison for so long that he became [[Institutionalisation|institutionalised]], the longest continuous serving inmate in the New South Wales prison system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Heinrichs | coauthors= | title=The oldest kid on the block | date=13 May 2007 | url =http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/the-oldest-kid-on-the-block/2007/05/12/1178899169277.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |pages= 2| accessdate =28 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in 2003 "I have no desire to go and live on the outside.

'''Malachy Martin''' (also '''Malachi Earl Martin''') (c.1831 – 24 December 1862) lived in [[South Australia]] in the 19th century and was convicted and executed for committing a willful murder in 1862.  Although in most official records his given name is written as “Malachi” it is clear that his parents actually gave him the traditional Irish form of the name, popularised through the veneration of St. Malachy, a twelfth-century Bishop of Amagh.&lt;ref&gt;Martin’s marriage certificate shows this spelling, while on that certificate he signed his name “Malacky” (1858 marriage certificate indexed by Births, Deaths and Marriages South Australia at Book 317, Page 541).  On his petition to the Governor in December 1862 Martin signed his name “Malaky Martin” (Malachy Martin’s petition to the Governor &amp; Executive Council of South Australia, GRG 24/6/1862/1215).  In oral tradition the name is pronounced in a way that indicates it should be spelt “Malachy” rather than the Biblical “Malachi”.  John Bowyer Bull, who had met Malachy, mentions him in his memoirs, and although he spells the name several ways, they are all closer to “Malachy” than to “Malachi” (J.B. Bull, unpublished manuscript ''The Life of John Bowyer Bull, The Australian Bushman &amp; Explorer, 1838-1894'', PGR 507/3, pp 62-65).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Martin grew up around the [[Willunga, South Australia|Willunga]] district, south of [[Adelaide]] and in 1844, just before he turned 13, he was charged with theft while working at a post office at the settlement at [[Encounter Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern Australian, 5 July 1844&lt;/ref&gt;  He was tried at Adelaide but found not guilty.  Six days later, his mother, Mary, died in strange circumstances by drowning in a pond near the family farm.  Although all witnesses stated that they had not observed anything to cause them to question her state of mind, the inquest into her death found that she had committed suicide “while labouring under temporary insanity" due to her distress over her son's criminal trial.  Her death was made even more tragic because she was heavily pregnant at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Australian, 19 July 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of William Robinson==
A few years later, Martin moved to his father's new pastoral lease near the [[Coorong]].  Martin also worked as a mail coach driver from Encounter Bay to [[Kingston SE, South Australia|Kingston SE]] and [[Naracoorte, South Australia|Naracoorte]].  At the time this was the only [[Princes Highway|main road]] from Adelaide to [[Melbourne, Victoria|Melbourne]].  While living in the area, he became friends with William and Catherine Robinson, who ran an inn, the ''Traveller’s Rest'' at [[Salt Creek, South Australia|Salt Creek]], a small settlement along the Coorong.  It was later believed that Catherine and Martin were having an affair which was to have fatal consequences.  On 14 June 1856, William Robinson's body was discovered with his throat cut.  Martin was a suspect, but was never charged with his murder.  Several weeks later, he moved to [[Sydney]] for two years before returning to South Australia and marrying Catherine on 23 June 1858.

==Murder of Jane Macmanamin==
A young woman named [[Jane Macmanamin]] was working at ''Traveller’s Rest'', but in February 1862 she disappeared.  Although Martin stated she had moved away on a whim to the [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]] area in the colony's south east, in April 1862, Jane's sister, who had constantly stayed in contact with her, sent a letter to the police in Adelaide, suspicious because she had not heard from Jane in some time.  This matter was being investigated by Lance Corporal William Rollison from the [[Wellington, South Australia|Wellington]] police station.&lt;ref&gt;State Records (South Australia) GRG 5/2/1862/1740, enclosure 510&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 May, a Ngarrindjeri local, "Micky", told William Allen of Woods Wells (11 miles — about 18 kilometres — north of Salt Creek) that a fellow Ngarrindjeri by the name of Itawanie had found Jane's body hidden and partially buried in a [[wombat]] hole about half a mile (about 800 meters) north of Martin's house.  Allen telegraphed the police at [[Strathalbyn, South Australia|Strathalbyn]],&lt;ref&gt;Adelaide Observer, 7 June 1862&lt;/ref&gt; where the message was received by Police Trooper [[Paul Foelsche]] who reported this by telegraph to headquarters and then rode to Wellington to inform Rollison of the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;GRG 5/2/1862/1740, Foelsche’s telegram dated 29 May 1862&lt;/ref&gt;  Rollison subsequently began a long and very thorough investigation into the murder, and it is largely through his reports to Police Headquarters that so much detail is known about the case.&lt;ref&gt;GRG 5/2/1862/1740, enclosure 510&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1862, Martin was charged with the murder of Jane Macmanamin.  Another man, William Wilsen, who claimed he had been engaged to her, was charged with being an accessory after the fact.  Martin was tried and found guilty.  He was hanged at the [[Adelaide Gaol]] on 24 December 1862 (Christmas Eve).  He is buried between the walls within the gaol.  Wilsen was found guilty of assisting Martin after the murder and sentenced to four years hard labour.  He was deported to [[Tasmania]] to carry out his sentence.

==Other possible murders==
As well as the two murders which were attributed to Martin, there was also suspicion as to the disappearances of two men from the Salt Creek area in 1859.  A traveller found a damaged rosewood jeweller's box approximately two and half miles from Salt Creek.  On inspection, it contained a piece of linen with the name “G. F. King” written on one of the corners.  It was suggested by Edward Bright, a contemporary diarist that a man named Harry Kirby and a jeweller stayed at the ''Traveller’s Rest'' and subsequently disappeared.

The police also investigated reports from local Ngarrindjeri that Martin had murdered an indigenous teenager with whom he had had an altercation.  Sometime after the boy's suspicious disappearance, a group of indigenous people were bathing in a deep water hole near Salt Creek.  They found the boy's body in a bag, weighted down by a large stone.  This incident occurred sometime in late 1859 or early 1860, but the police were unable to find any witnesses who would admit to having actually seen the body, only people who claimed to have heard the story from others.

==Early life==
Ivan Milat was the son of a [[Croats|Croatian]] emigrant and labourer, Stjepan Marko "Steven" Milat (1902–1983), and an Australian, Margaret Elizabeth Piddleston (1920–2001), who married when she was 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Malcolm|last2=Feneley|first2=Rick|title=Life never a picnic for the dirt-poor, troubled Milat clan|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/life-never-a-picnic-for-the-dirtpoor-troubled-milat-clan-20101123-185r8.html|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Les|title=Does crime run in the Milat family tree?|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/does-crime-run-in-the-milat-family-tree-20101127-18bg2.html|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heavenaddress.com/restingplace/margaret-elizabeth-milat/278434|title=Margaret Elizabeth Milat – HeavenAddress Resting Place|website=www.heavenaddress.com|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milat was the fifth-born of their 14 children,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Les|title=Milat case stalked by uncertainty|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/stalked-by-uncertainty/2005/07/20/1121539033488.html|accessdate=25 January 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=21 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing family first lived in [[Bossley Park]] before relocating to [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]]. Many of the 10 Milat boys were well known to local police, and Milat displayed antisocial behaviour at a young age, leading to a stint in a residential school at age 13.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-109-belanglo-part-3/|title=Case 109: Belanglo (Part 3)|date=6 April 2019|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 17, he was in a juvenile detention centre for theft, and at 19, was involved in a shop break in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1964, he was sentenced to 18 months for a break and enter, and a month after release, he was arrested for driving a stolen car and was sentenced to 2 years hard labour.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In September 1967, aged 23, he was sentenced to 3 years for theft.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In April 1971, he was charged with the abduction of two 18 year-old hitchhikers and the rape of one of them.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivan Milat Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/ivan-milat-17169710|work=[[The Biography Channel]]|publisher=A+E Television Networks, LLC.|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While awaiting trial, he was involved in a string of robberies with some of his brothers, before faking his suicide and fleeing to New Zealand for a year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was rearrested in 1974, but the robbery and kidnap cases against him failed at trial with the help of the Milat's family lawyer, [[John Marsden (lawyer)|John Marsden]]. He took on a job as a truck driver in 1975, and by the time of the [[Belanglo State Forest]] crimes, Milat had worked on and off for 20 years for the [[Roads &amp; Traffic Authority]] all over the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Background===
By the time of the first Belanglo State Forest discoveries, several backpackers had been reported missing. One case involved a young [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] couple from [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], Deborah Everist (19) and James Gibson (19), who had been missing since leaving Sydney for [[ConFest]], near Albury, on 30 December 1989.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://casefilepodcast.com/case-109-belanglo-part-1/|title=Case 109: Belanglo (Part 1)|date=2019-03-23|website=Casefile: True Crime Podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another related to Simone Schmidl (21), from Germany, who had been missing since leaving Sydney for Melbourne on 20 January 1991.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Similarly, a German couple, Gabor Neugebauer (21) and Anja Habschied (20), had disappeared after leaving a [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] hostel for Mildura on 26 December 1991. Another involved missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke (21) and Joanne Walters (22), who were last seen in Kings Cross on 18 April 1992.&lt;ref name="Sorrow"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/friends-born-of-sorrow/2006/04/23/1145730809381.html'?page=fullpage|title=Friends born of sorrow|last=Meacham|first=Steve|date=24 April 2006|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his death, Milat wrote a letter to his family requesting that his funeral be paid for by the New South Wales Government. The request was denied by NSW Corrections Minister Anthony Roberts.

In 2012, Milat's great-nephew Matthew Milat and his friend Cohen Klein (both aged 19 at the time of their sentencing) were sentenced to 43 years and 32 years in prison, respectively, for murdering David Auchterlonie on his 17th birthday with an axe at the Belanglo State Forest in November 2010. Matthew Milat struck Auchterlonie with the double-headed axe as Klein audio-recorded the attack with a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=Jamelle|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-08/milat-relative-gets-30-years-for-axe-murder/4060442|title=Milat relative gets 30 years for axe murder|date=9 June 2012|newspaper=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dale|first=Amy|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/matthew-milat-sentenced-to-43-years/story-e6frfkvr-1226388884080|title=Matthew Milat sentenced to 30 years jail for 'cold blooded' murder|date=8 June 2012|newspaper=News.com.au|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Milat's brother Boris Milat told Steve Aperen, a former homicide detective who serves as a consultant with the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], that Milat was responsible for another shooting: that of taxi cab driver Neville Knight, in 1962 after Milat admitted to the crime. After conducting [[polygraph]] tests with Boris Milat and Allan Dillon, the man convicted of Knight's shooting, Aperen is convinced that Milat did in fact shoot Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lees|first1=Philippa|url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunday-night/features/a/27411151/detective-says-no-doubt-over-ivan-milat-claim/|title=Detective Says 'No Doubt' Over Ivan Milat Claim|date=3 May 2015|work=[[Yahoo!

'''Martha Marek''' (''née'' '''Löwenstein'''; 1904 – December 6, 1938) was an [[Austria]]n [[serial killer]] who caused media attention during the interwar period.

== Insurance fraud ==
Martha Löwenstein inherited a villa in the Vienna Woods and financial means in August 1923 from her 50-year-old patron as sole heir, months later she married the student Emil Marek. Within two years, the money was used up by the couple.

In 1925 Martha and her husband Emil first entered the mass media coverage: Emil had lost his leg while chopping wood on June 25, 1925, a day after Martha had put an insurance policy on him.&lt;ref&gt;Nettersheim, Christoph, ''Schrecklich nette Frauen''.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;As the circumstances were very strange to the insurance company, they refused to pay the sum and a lawsuit began. In the course of which, forensics experts were able to clearly prove by multiple traces on the leg that it was self-mutilation. Emil Marek, who was almost fully obedient to his wife, had purposely injured himself to get the sum insured.

The public, however, was largely on the beautiful Marek's side and suspected that the insurance company wanted to suppress the payment through legal mishaps. Marek and her husband were acquitted of fraud in 1927 and sentenced to only a small prison sentence, as Martha had tried to bribe or slander the coroners. The insurance company agreed to settle the matters out of court and paid a large sum of money.

== Prison ==
Martha Marek spent the short prison time in a cell with the poisoner [[Leopoldine Lichtenstein]], who in 1925 had poisoned her husband with the [[thallium]]-containing rat paste "Zelio".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Thallium-Vergiftung (Selbstmordversuch mit Zeliopaste) |trans-title=Thallium poisoning (suicide attempt with Zeliopaste) |last=Heinichen |first=W. |date=December 1931 |journal=[[Archives of Toxicology|Sammlung von Vergiftungsfällen]] |language=de |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=27–28 |doi=10.1007/BF02460485}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allegedly inspired Martha to do her other deeds. After the media popularity had subsided, the sum had been used up and Emil's entrepreneurial plans as an inventor had failed, the Mareks experienced economic hardship.

== Murders ==
After Emil Marek, who had always been sickly after the leg amputation, died unexpectedly on July 31, 1932, public attention returned to the widow. When her two children developed similar symptoms and their daughter died shortly after, Martha was able to play off the role of a long-suffering widow and mother, and she was given a broad wave of compassion, including financial donations. An aunt of hers, Susanne Löwenstein, even went so far as to appoint her as her sole heir, and promptly died thereafter in 1934.

After Marek had used up the inheritance, she found in tailor Felicitas Kittenberger another victim. Kittenberger was taken in by Marek as a subtenant and was persuaded to take a life insurance in Martha's favour. Kittenberger died shortly after, which, however, aroused the suspicion of her son, who filed charges. The subsequent investigation and exhumation of the bodies revealed that Marek had murdered all four victims with the toxic Zelio paste, which was then freely available.

== Conviction ==
Back in court, Martha Marek faked seizures and blindness, and had to be carried to the courtroom in a specially-constructed chair. She was [[sentenced to death]] on May 19, 1938 by the jury, with the court assuming that Marek, as a woman, following the Austrian tradition, would be pardoned by the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] for [[life imprisonment]]. In the meantime, however, Austria had been attached to the [[German Reich]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] rejected the petition for clemency. Marek was executed on December 6, 1938, as the first delinquent on the recently brought from [[Berlin]] to Vienna guillotine, in the Vienna Regional Court by the executioner [[Johann Reichhart]].

'''Gennady Modestovich Mikhasevich''' ({{lang-be|Генадзь Мадэставіч Міхасевіч}}; 7 April, 1947 – 25 September, 1987) was a prolific [[Soviet]] [[serial killer]]. He murdered 33&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://crynews.ru/persprint/553.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830133946/http://crynews.ru/persprint/553.html |archivedate=2011-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; women during the period from 1971 to 1985 in [[Vitebsk]], [[Polotsk]] and the rural areas in the nearby regions of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]].

== Biography ==
Gennady Mikhasevich was born in the village of Ist ([[Vitebsk Oblast]]) in 1947,&lt;ref name="Newton_177"&gt;Newton, Michael (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=DwNVbOcTncwC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq= ''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'']. Infobase Publishing. p. 177. {{ISBN|0816069875}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and served in the army. He committed his first murder in May 1971. He himself later explained that the killing spree started after he had returned from the army only to find out that his girlfriend had left him and got married in the meantime. On the night of 14 May, 1971, he was on his way from [[Vitebsk]] to [[Polotsk]]. It was late so he could not catch a bus to Polotsk where his parents lived. Mikhasevich reported that he was feeling despondent because of the breakup with his girlfriend, and had prepared a loop to [[suicide|hang himself]]. By chance, however, he encountered a young woman on the road and, in order to vent his anger, decided to kill her. He murdered again in October 1971, and strangled two other women in 1972, near Vitebsk. Mikhasevich graduated from a technical school in Vitebsk in 1973 and returned to Ist, starting work in a [[sovkhoz]]. He got married in 1976. In the meantime, the murders went on.  

Many of his murders were committed to facilitate [[rape]]. He invariably strangled or smothered his victims, either assaulting them in solitary locations or, during later years, after having lured them into his own red [[Zaporozhets]] or the machines of his workplace (he later had a job in machine repair service). Mikhasevich did not carry weapons, choosing instead to use a variety of improvised means, including in one case, a cord made of [[rye]]. Besides killing, he robbed his victims of money and valuable items, some of which he would later present to his wife as a gift. He would also take mundane household items, like scissors.

In outward appearance, Gennady Mikhasevich was a good family man, a [[teetotaller]] with two children and was a conscientious worker; he was also a member of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]] (also serving as a local party functionary) and of [[Voluntary People's Druzhina]].

The investigation started to advance in the 1980s, as the young investigator Nikolay Ignatovich firmly believed that all the killings of females near motorways in the region were not separate, isolated cases as previous investigators had conveniently believed, but had in fact been committed by one person, a [[serial killer]]. The police also suspected that the serial killer was using a red Zaporozhets; as they started checking all the people of the Oblast who possessed such a car, Mikhasevich, [[Voluntary People's Druzhina|as a druzhinnik]], participated in these actions - essentially, searching for himself.&lt;ref name="Newton_177"/&gt; This also gave him insight into the investigation itself, enabling him to learn of the steps investigators were taking beforehand, and allowing Mikhasevich to plan his own steps to avoid them. The year 1985 was especially 'prolific' for the murderer: he killed 12 women in this year alone.

Eventually, Mikhasevich, who was now getting concerned, made a fatal mistake. In order to derail the investigation, he sent an anonymous letter to the local newspaper on behalf of an imaginary underground organization, 'Patriots of Vitebsk', purportedly calling on his fellow militants to intensify their struggle of killing communists and lewd women. When he left a similar hand-written note next to his new victim, again signed on behalf of 'Patriots of Vitebsk', the investigators started to ascertain the handwriting of the male residents of the Oblast. Having checked 556,000 samples, the experts detected that the sample with the handwriting of Gennady Modestovich Mikhasevich bore a striking resemblance to the handwriting on the murderer's notes. Further investigation revealed other evidence, convincing them of Mikhasevich's guilt. 

He was finally arrested in December 1985, after initial denial, he confessed and was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in 1987. His case became notorious in the USSR (“The Vitebsk Case” (“Витебское дело”)), as it revealed both the incompetence of the police and the corruption of the [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]]: by the time Mikhasevich was finally arrested, 14 people had already been convicted for the crimes Mikhasevich committed, the suspects had been often forced to confess by torture, and a couple of them had been sentenced to death and executed for crimes they did not commit.

'''Igor Alexandrovich Mirenkov '''(1969 - June 19, 1996) was a Soviet-[[Belarus]]ian [[serial killer]] who killed six boys aged 9–14 between 1990 and 1993.

== Biography ==
Igor Mirenkov was born in 1969 in the city of [[Svietlahorsk]] in the [[Byelorussian SSR]], where he later lived out his life and committed all his crimes. After school, Mirenkov was called to serve in the [[Northern Fleet]], where it was reported that he exhibited [[homosexual]] tendencies and solicited his colleagues. The investigator in the Mirenkov case, Oleg Litoshko, later stated that perhaps the sailors had raped him, which later led to Mirenkov's deformed mentality.&lt;ref name="igor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detektiv.by/svetlogorsk?page=9%2C2|title=Светлогорский кошмар|publisher=Detective documentary|accessdate=2010-09-28|language=ru|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68ZZxfQVK?url=http://www.detektiv.by/svetlogorsk?page=9,2|archivedate=2012-06-20|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to Svietlahorsk, Mirenkov got a job and bought a [[Jawa Moto|JAWA]]-brand motorcycle and began living a normal life.&lt;ref name="igor" /&gt; Mirenkov was absolutely inperceptible. Litoshko later said this:
{{cquote|...If he was in the crowd, I wouldn't have noticed him. Absolutely inconspicious man. But he could support the conversation. Conducted conversations on various topics...&lt;ref name="igor" /&gt;}}

== Murder series ==
The first murder Mirenkov committed was on June 2, 1990. His victim was a 13-year-old boy who was walking in the woods whom he attacked, [[raped]], and killed with his knife. On April 16, 1991, he killed a 10-year-old boy under similar circumstances. At first, nobody made a connection to the killings, but Mirenkov decided to temporarily hide. For the whole of 1992, he did not commit a single murder due to being sentenced to three years of [[penal labour]] for robbery. Since Mirenkov was a model prisoner, he was often given a three-day leave, when he would commit his murders.&lt;ref name="igor" /&gt;

On March 20, 1993, Mirenkov committed a third murder, and on March 30 - a fourth. The city began to panic, the people started making adherents of the "[[Marina Tsvigun|White Вrotherhood]]", out of fear that Romani people or criminal gangs were kidnapping the children. During the summer of 1993, Mirenkov committed a further two murders, whose bodies were later found in a nearby forest in autumn. Parents took to the city of Svietlahorsk, organizing [[Picketing|pickets]] of the district administration, and creating self-defense committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.org.ua/bookreader.php/126300/Revyako_-_Ubiiicy_i_man%27yaki.html|title=ИГОРЬ МИРЕНКОВ — "СВЕТЛОГОРСКОЕ ДЕЛО"|date=1995|publisher=Bolshoy online library e-Reading|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68ZZyJ0Wx?url=http://www.e-reading.org.ua/bookreader.php/126300/Revyako,_Trus_-_Ubiiicy_i_man'yaki.html|archive-date=2012-06-20|access-date=2010-09-28|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest, investigation and trial ==
On April 27, 1994, Igor Mirenkov was arrested for stealing [[gasoline]] and [[insurance fraud]]. He pleaded guilty and was imprisoned. On May 14, 1994, he was summoned for [[interrogation]] in the case of disappearances and murders of the children. He later confessed to six murders. The Belarusian authorities decided on unprecedented measures - the case was classified (and only declassified in 2007), and Mirenkov was put in [[solitary confinement]] in the city of [[Rechytsa]], and investigative experiments were conducted within the framework of increased security measures for the defendant. The investigation lasted for more than a year, and after the criminal case was transferred to the Gomel Regional Court, Igor Alexandrovich Mirenkov was [[sentenced to death]]. On June 19, 1996, the verdict was carried out in the SIZO No. 1 Detention Unit in the city of [[Minsk]].&lt;ref name="igor" /&gt;

'''José Vicente Matias''' (born September 24, 1966 in [[Firminópolis]], [[Goiás]]), also known as '''"Corumbá"''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[serial killer]] and former [[artisan]] who raped, murdered and then dismembered 6 women between 1999 and 2005. In addition to killing, Matias also practised [[cannibalism]] with the remains of his victims, ingesting blood and brain pieces from them.

In his testimonies, 'Corumbá' gave contradictory statements on several occasions. He sometimes mentioned suffering "influences" from the [[Devil]], who whispered in his ear that his mission was to kill seven women, while on other occasions, he cited [[xenophobia]] and jokes aimed at his [[sexual impotence]]. Before this, he had been arrested by the police for rape and violent assault. He was sentenced to 23 years imprisonment on June 2, 2008.

'''Michael Wayne McGray''' (born July 11, 1965) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[serial killer|serial  killer]] convicted of killing seven individuals, and claims to have killed eleven others, between 1985 and 1998.

==Early life==
McGray was born in [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]], [[Ontario]], but was raised in [[Argyle, Nova Scotia|Argyle]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/37883-mcgray-gets-another-life-term thechronicleherald.ca: "McGray gets another life term"], 30 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
On May 1, 1985, McGray murdered 17-year-old hitchhiker Elizabeth Gale Tucker in a wooded area near [[Weymouth, Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=gm/&gt; Gregory George Ashford was interviewed in connection with this murder.&lt;ref&gt;The Ottawa Citizen: "Murder suspect returned to Toronto", 30 Dec 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cox |first1=Kevin |title=Serial killer pleads guilty in teen's death |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/serial-killer-pleads-guilty-in-teens-death/article4148577/ |website=theglobeandmail.com |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=May 30, 2001|accessdate=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 1987, McGray and two accomplices, Mark Gibbons, and Norm Warren robbed a taxi driver in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]]. After police arrival, Gibbons' dead body was discovered at Market Square. Warren was charged with the murder of Gibbons, however he was found not guilty of murder after a jury trial. McGray received a five-year prison sentence for his role in the robbery, but was not charged in connection with Gibbons' death.&lt;ref name="SKF"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simpson |first1=Paul |title=The Serial Killer Files |date=May 18, 2017 |publisher=Little Brown Book Group |isbn=978-1-47213-673-2 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=949zCwAAQBAJ |accessdate=July 13, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gm/&gt;

In 1991, McGray was still serving time in prison due to his 1987 robbery conviction, however, he was given a three-day weekend pass to stay at a halfway house in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] during Easter weekend. On March 30, 1991, McGray met Robert Assaly in Montreal's Gay Village. Assaly invited McGray back to his apartment where McGray fatally stabbed him in the throat and chest multiple times. On March 31, 1991, McGray returned to the Gay Village and met Gaetan Ethier, who invited McGray back to his apartment. After spending the night at Ethier's apartment, McGray stabbed Ethier to death. McGray did not return to prison after his three-day weekend pass, however, he was re-arrested only a few days later.&lt;ref name="SKF"/&gt;

The [[National Parole Board]] expressed concern in 1995 about McGray's problems with anger and [[substance abuse]], and that McGray disappeared for more than a year while on [[parole]], "which clearly indicated a serious breach of trust and a blatant disregard for conditions of release."&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://www.walnet.org/csis/news/halifax_2000/cp-000324.html Canadian Press: "Police looking at unsolved cases for links to McGray's claims"], 24 Mar 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of February 28, 1998, Joan Hicks and her 11-year-old daughter Nina in [[Moncton, New Brunswick]] were murdered at their apartment. Joan was found lying on the floor of the bathroom in a pool of blood, having been beaten, strangled and her throat cut with serrated knife. Her daughter Nina was found hung in her bedroom closet by a piece of rope after having been choked with a rope.&lt;ref name="SKF"/&gt; McGray was named by a witness as the murderer and he was arrested the next day.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/possible-serial-killer-in-custody-in-moncton-1.184325 cbc.ca: "Possible serial killer in custody in Moncton"], 29 Oct 1999&lt;/ref&gt; 

He later confessed to murders of Robert Assaly and Gaetan Ethier in 1991.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; 

On March 20, 2000, he pled guilty to the murder of Hicks.&lt;ref name=gm/&gt; McGray claims to have killed 11 other victims across Canada, including [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], Saint John, Montreal, [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Calgary]], [[Vancouver]], and the [[Americans|American]] city of [[Seattle]]. He claimed that he would provide information to the authorities on the killings in exchange for specific demands being met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/M/McGRAY_michael_wayne.php |title=crimezzz.net: "serial killers by name – McGRAY Michael Wayne" |access-date=2012-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191210121926/http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/M/McGRAY_michael_wayne.php |archive-date=2019-12-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gm&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/i-got-very-good-at-it-killer-says/article4162061/ G+M: "'I got very good at it,' killer says"], 24 Mar 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, McGray was charged with a sixth murder, the 1985 killing of Elizabeth Gail Tucker in Nova Scotia. This charge occurred as a result of several interviews he gave the previous year; as a result of the interviews, police across the country re-opened [[cold case]] files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/serial-killer-charged-with-nova-scotia-teen-s-murder-1.259729 cbc.ca: "Serial killer charged with Nova Scotia teen's murder"], 23 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; McGray blamed his urge to kill on beatings he received as a child, and warned he would kill again if he did not receive proper treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/11/29/prison-couldnt-keep-michael-wayne-mcgray-from-killing-just-like-he-said-it-wouldnt/ nationalpost.com: "Prison couldn’t keep Michael Wayne McGray from killing — just like he said it wouldn’t"], 29 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, following a transfer to the [[Mountain Institution]] medium-security prison in [[Agassiz, British Columbia|Agassiz]], [[British Columbia]], McGray killed his cellmate, 33-year-old Jeremy Phillips. The [[Crown prosecutor]] related that McGray claimed that Phillips invented a false hostage-taking scenario where McGray would tie him up, and Phillips would then be brought to an [[infirmary]]; McGray complied with the plan, and then strangled Phillips. Lawyers of the victim's family doubted the claims, as Phillips was scheduled to be released on parole, while two inmates related that Phillips had requested to not be held in the same block as McGray, but prison officers denied the request. A resulting [[Coroner|coroner's]] inquest recommended that serial killers be housed in single cells. The [[Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec|Ste-Anne-des-Plaines Institution]], which was reputed to be the highest-security prison in Canada, housed McGray in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/11/01/dont-make-serial-killers-roomies-in-prison-coroners-jury-recommends/ nationalpost.com: "Don't make serial killers roomies in prison, coroner's jury recommends"], 1 Nov 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2019, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court revealed that McGray was the prime suspect in the 1995 murder of Brenda Way who was found with her neck slashed in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Her boyfriend, Glen Assoun had been convicted and spent 17 years in prison for the crime he always denied.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Weaver (July 12, 2019).

According to the investigating authorities, Martínez buried most of his victims in [[Potter's field|potter's fields]] at depths of 3 meters, wrapped in several years of canvas, at a farm where he worked, as a method to forcibly hide the bodies.

'''Buenaventura Nepomuceno Matallana''' (September 1891&amp;nbsp;– 24 January 1960) was a Colombian criminal, murderer, and suspected [[serial killer]]. He was tried and sentenced to 24 years imprisonment for the 1949 murder of merchant Alfredo Forero Vanegas, and he was also suspected to be responsible for the disappearances of at least six or seven others to whom he pretended to be a lawyer, signing broad powers over his properties under the pretext of a big business, after which the clients either disappeared or were found dead.&lt;ref name="Aguilera"&gt;Aguilera Peña, Mario.

Edición en la biblioteca virtual: 2005-05-17. Disponible en: Biblioteca Virtual del Banco de la República.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and conviction ==
His trial, prolonged and complicated by deceit of the defendant's legal expert and by the weakness of the research organizations, caused great sensation and expectation in the Colombian society. The judge had to borrow a theater to hold the hearings, due to the large number of people present. [[Gabriel García Márquez|Gabrial García Márquez]] said in one of his chronicles that "...the public hearings that are held in Bogotá to judge Nepomuceno Matallana, the famous Doctor Mata, are making competition to ''The right to be born''", referring to the [[radionovela]] that caused the greatest national harmony.&lt;ref&gt;García Márquez, Gabriel. Textos costeños, Volumen 2. Obra periodística, Editorial Sudamericana, 1987. {{ISBN|9500704218}}, 9789500704212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Caicedo Garzón, Armando.[http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-206949 Clave 1951 El doctor Mata]. eltiempo.com. 11 de diciembre de 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his trial he escaped twice, once during the [[Bogotazo|riots of April 9, 1948]]. Concerning of what he was accused, Matallana never confessed his guilt. The unanimous verdict of the jury was to condemn him to the maximum penalty of 24 years according to what was then the force in Colombia. In the same conditions, Hipólito Herrera, the accomplice active in Forero's murder, was convicted and confessed to the police the exact location of where the body was buried in exchange for chicken broth. However, while serving the sentence in the Panóptico prison in [[Tunja]], Matallana declared that the trial had flaws in the procedures, and at the end of the 50s, the second public hearing was started against him for the "Crime of Calderitas" (the nickname the press gave to Forero's murder case, as the body was found in the Calderitas wasteland).&lt;ref name="Aguilera"&gt;Aguilera Peña, Mario.

== Death ==
On 24 January 1960, Matallan died in the Modelo prison of Bogotá infirmary while waiting for the result of the new verdict. His death was caused by [[bronchitis]] with [[heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;''El Tiempo'', 25 de enero de 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, he received a religious ceremony in the National Voto temple, after which he was buried in the [[Central Cemetery of Bogotá]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FAsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K34EAAAAIBAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=887%2C3464243|title=Tres dolientes de verdad acompañaron al camposanto el cadáver de Matallana|date=1960-01-27|access-date=2018-12-04|df=dmy-all|agency=El Tiempo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
John Jairo Moreno Torres was born in the Colombian capital of Bogotá, growing up in a [[dysfunctional family]] with economic problems. He suffered a burn on his leg at an early age, which eventually earned him the name "Johnny the Leper".&lt;ref name="JEL" /&gt; He left school at the age of 13 and become the leader of a gang that operated in the localities of [[Fontibón]] and [[Kennedy, Bogotá|Kennedy]] during the 1990s. At the time, it was the most feared band in Bogotá.&lt;ref name="CARACOL"&gt;[https://caracol.com.co/radio/1998/02/28/nacional/0888649200_088073.html Sicópata de 20 años tenía aterrorizados a los habitantes de Kennedy y Fontibón] [[Caracol Radio]]. Consultado el 10 de mayo de 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Torres was linked to several murders and rapes that occurred in various neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="JEL"&gt;[https://www.publimetro.co/co/bogota/2015/12/06/asesinos-serie-mas-peligrosos-bogota.html Los asesinos en serie más peligrosos de Bogotá] ''[[Publimetro]]''. Consultado el 10 de mayo de 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the gang's leader, he murdered several people using firearms, knives and machetes.&lt;ref name="JEL"&gt;[https://www.publimetro.co/co/bogota/2015/12/06/asesinos-serie-mas-peligrosos-bogota.html Los asesinos en serie más peligrosos de Bogotá] ''[[Publimetro]]''. Consultado el 10 de mayo de 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; The group then expanded and settled in several of the city's territories. With this, it displaced other criminal organizations and monopolized the micro-trafficking of drugs. In view of all the events, the Colombian authorities investigated thoroughly and established strategies to capture the gang's members. They managed to track down where Moreno Torres' partner lived and waited at the site for him to arrive. Once identified, he was immediately captured.&lt;ref name="IDEN"&gt;[https://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-745673 La entraña de Johnny El Leproso] [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|''El Tiempo'']].

'''Luis Gregorio Ramírez Maestre''' (born in [[Valledupar]] on September 30, 1980) is a [[Colombia]]n [[serial killer]]. He is accused of murdering thirty people in various municipalities and cities in Colombia, including [[Tenerife, Magdalena|Tenerife]], [[Sabanalarga, Atlántico|Sabanalarga]], Aguachica, Santa Marta, Valledupar and Puerto Wilches.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.vanguardia.com/santander/barrancabermeja/187487-presunto-asesino-en-serie-de-barrancabermeja-acepto-cargos-por-homi|title=Presunto asesino en serie de Barrancabermeja aceptó cargos por homicidio|access-date=8 September 2014|author=Enoe Del Pilar Sepúlveda|date=13 December 2012|publisher=vanguardia.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramírez chose motorists between 19 and 30 years of age. None measured more than 1.70 metres tall or weighed more than 60 kilos (5'5" and 137 lbs respectively). This was done in order to make them submit easily. His tactic was simple and effective. He took advantage of his charisma and loquacity to generate trust. He asked to be taken on a motorcycle taxi to a carefully chosen place, on the outskirts of the cities where he acted. Taking advantage of the fact that he was in the back of the vehicle and after talking with the driver all the way, when they stopped he held the driver by the throat and suffocated them, taking care of them to not die, until they lost consciousness.

The vast majority of people were killed by suffocation or torture, according to examinations of forensics experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-12745082|title=La macabra ruta del 'Monstruo de Tenerife'|access-date=8 September 2014|author=Julián Espinos Rojas|date=16 April 2013|publisher=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also he kept several personal objects from victims, like wallets, cards, mobiles, helmets, etc. Ramírez only confessed to the murder of a person known as John Jairo Amador de la Rosa, after authorities found the body wrapped up in ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/hombre-acepto-responsabilidad-tortura-y-homicidio-de-mo-articulo-392508|title=Hombre aceptó responsabilidad en la tortura y homicidio de mototaxista|access-date=8 September 2014|publisher=[[El Espectador (periódico)|El Espectador]]|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the murderer was only dedicated to stealing motorcycles in various municipalities, but according to several specialists, Ramírez acted in an antisocial way, similar to a psychopath.

He was ultimately found guilty of several murders and sentenced to 57 years in prison, later lowered to 34 years for "acceptance of charges".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://elmeridianodecordoba.com.co/index.php?option%3Dcom_k2%26view%3Ditem%26id%3D39223:condenado-asesino-de-mototaxis%26Itemid%3D120"|title=«Condenado asesino de mototaxis»|access-date=8 September 2014|publisher=elmeridianodecordoba.com|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was captured in 2012.

Luis Gregorio Ramírez Maestro will be released from prison in the year 2032 when he has been in prison for 20 years, due to the reductions of sentences in the Colombian justice system of three fifths of the sentence.

'''Václav Mrázek''' (October 22, 1925 &amp;ndash; December 29, 1957&lt;ref&gt;[https://zpravy.idnes.cz/foto.aspx?r=krimi&amp;c=A171215_123038_krimi_iri&amp;foto=IRI7003c0_DSC09263.JPG Protocol of execution]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Prague]]) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[serial killer]] who was convicted of murdering seven people. Six of his victims were women, and one was a man. His murders (or attempted murders) were primarily sexually motivated, although he also burgled his victims' homes. Besides murders, he was convicted of 127 other [[crime]]s.

Despite being searched for in relation to the murders in the [[Chomutov]] region (where he committed most of his crimes), he evaded capture for a long time. He was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] in 1957, the same year he was captured and he was executed on December 29, 1957 in [[Pankrác Prison]].

== Childhood ==
Václav Mrázek was born in a small village of [[Svinařov]] as one of 12 children. His father was a [[miner]], who was also a binge drinker and used to [[Physical abuse|beat]] both his wife and the children. Often hungry at home, Mrázek started stealing from an early age, encouraged by his mother.

== Capture ==
Mrázek was caught in March 1957 during a house inspection following a theft in the [[Libušín]] mine, where he was working as a spa staff attendant.

==Crimes==
Mansour left his home in Tanta, a town north of Cairo, and joined a street gang at an early age. Gang leaders taught him skills of survival, allegedly cutting him with razors when he made any mistakes.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; According to his confession, Mansour soon learned the method of getting back at those who crossed him by raping them, and murdered anyone who threatened to go to the police afterwards.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; One of the victims, 12-year-old boy Ahmed Nagui, had been a member of Mansour's gang. When Mansour tried to sexually assault him, Nagui reported him to the police, and Mansour was arrested but was released for lack of evidence. Soon after Mansour raped and murdered Nagui in retaliation, according to the prosecutors.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; 

Mansour frequently traveled between Cairo and [[Alexandria]] by train. He felt safer in Alexandria because it had fewer police officers.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; The Vice Department of Borg El-Arab police station in Alexandria started keeping a profile on him during this time.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; Mansour and his gang members lured street children onto the carriage roof of the trains, where they then stripped, raped and tortured them, and tossed them naked onto the trackside, dead or barely alive.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt;&lt;ref name=et/&gt; Some of the children were dumped into the [[Nile]], or buried alive.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; Mansour and his gang's crimes came to light in 2006 when two of his gang members were arrested, and Mansour acquired the nickname "al-Tourbini" meaning "Express Train", from his favorite location for the crimes.&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; After the arrest, Mansour reportedly told prosecutors that he was possessed by a female [[Genie|jinn]] who commanded him to commit the crimes.&lt;ref name=et/&gt; Mansour, along with his accomplice Farag Samir Mahmoud, also known as "Hanata", were convicted and sentenced to death by the criminal court in Tanta in 2007.&lt;ref name=taipei/&gt; He was executed in 2010.

==Commercialization of the name==
Soon after the arrest, ''[[al-Ahram]]'', a widely circulated Egyptian newspaper, reported that some products in Egypt were being named after Mansour's nickname, "al-Tourbini".&lt;ref name=Daily_News_Egypt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; Several restaurants in Mansour's hometown, [[Tanta]], started selling a so-called "al-Tourbini sandwich", allegedly in demand by young locals.&lt;ref name=Daily_News_Egypt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bradley/&gt; Sheep merchants gave the name "al-Tourbini" to the large-size lamb priced at more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;[[Egyptian pound]].&lt;ref name=Daily_News_Egypt/&gt; Some [[tuk-tuk]] drivers named their vehicles "al-Tourbini" to attract customers.&lt;ref name=Daily_News_Egypt/&gt; According to ''al-Ahram'', the "strangest such marketing ploy" was that of owners of supermarkets and communications centers in Tanta were renaming their businesses "al-Tourbini: The Butcher of Gharbia". Author and journalist [[John R. Bradley]] commented in his book ''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' that "this reaction borders on the incomprehensible, but what it clearly indicates is that something has gone terribly wrong with contemporary Egyptian society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution | first = John R. | last = Bradley | pages = [https://archive.org/details/insideegyptlando00brad/page/200 200] | isbn = 1-4039-8477-8 | year = 2008 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | url = https://archive.org/details/insideegyptlando00brad/page/200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christine Malèvre''' (born January 10, 1970) is a former [[Nursing|nurse]] who was arrested in 1998 on suspicion of having killed as many as 30 patients. She confessed to some of the [[murder]]s, but claimed she had done so at the request of the patients, who were all [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. France, however, does not recognize a "[[right to die]]", and Malèvre eventually recanted most of her confessions. The families of several of her victims strongly denied that their relatives had expressed any will to die, much less asked Malèvre to kill them.

==Charges==

While in questioning, Christine Malèvre originally admitted to assisting in the death of 30 terminally ill patients at François Quesnay Hospital in [[Mantes-la-Jolie]] on the outskirts of Paris,&lt;ref name="Sage"&gt;Sage, Adam. "'Mercy killer' on murder charges." Times [London, England] 16 June 1999: 14. Academic OneFile. Web. 7 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a statement which she later on recanted stating that she made the original confession under duress.&lt;ref name="heroine"&gt;"Paris euthanasia 'heroine' on trial for 7 murders." Times [London, England] 21 Jan. 2003: 15. Academic OneFile. Web. 7 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although being originally charged with the lesser charge of [[manslaughter]], Malèvre's charge was upgraded to that of murder following a report that stated that the nurse had a “morbid fascination” with death and disease, and that patients were three to four times more likely to die while during Mme. Malèvre's duty periods in the advanced cancer ward.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; According to Olivier Morice, a lawyer for five patients’ families who had died in Malèvre's care, the charge of murder came about because the judge had realized “we are dealing with a serial killer more than with a Madonna of euthanasia”.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt; Prosecutors argued for this charge to be seen as a murder charge rather than manslaughter, because they believed Christine should be treated the same way as any other serial killer rather than a Madonna of euthanasia.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; 
Shortly after her release on bail, Malevre tried to commit suicide herself by overdosing on drugs, but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt;

==Trial==

Malèvre went on trial in Versailles on 20 January 2003 on charges of murdering seven gravely ill patients while working at [[François Quesnay]] Hospital between 1997 and 1998.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; She faced up to life in prison.&lt;ref name="French nurse"&gt;"French nurse jailed in 6 deaths." New York Times 1 Feb. 2003: A4. Academic OneFile. Web. 7 Mar. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Mme. Malèvre admitting to having killed four patients by injecting them with [[lethal doses]] of morphine, potassium or other various drugs,&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; but denied being responsible for the other three deaths.&lt;ref name="French nurse"/&gt; She went on to state that her reason for lethally injecting these patients was due to the fact that the patients requested to die, and she helped them do so out of compassion.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; In a book she later penned called “My Confession”, Malèvre stated “I helped people to end their suffering and depart in peace. I did not kill. I am not a criminal.”&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; Prosecutors on the other hand did not agree with this statement. Nicknamed ''The [[wikt:Black Widow|Black Widow]]'' by her colleagues, prosecutors told the court that Mme. Malèvre's motives for ending the lives of these gravely ill patients were not out of the kindness of her own heart, but rather due to her morbid fascination with death and illness, and by killing these patients she was satisfying her sick compulsions.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; Families of the deceased also went on the record to agree with the prosecution that Malèvre killed for her own good not for the good of her patients, denying that their relatives had ever asked to die,&lt;ref name="French nurse"/&gt; statements which later on turned many of Mme. Malèvre's supporters against her.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt;

==Sentencing==

After a four-hour deliberation, Mme. Malèvre was sentenced to ten years of prison for the murder of six of the seven patients she had ‘assisted’ in killing. On top of this sentence, Christine Malèvre was also permanently banned from working as a nurse.&lt;ref name="French nurse"/&gt;

==Controversy==

The arrest of Mme. Malèvre raised national debate over both the case, as well as the controversial topic of [[euthanasia]] in France, which does not allow euthanasia like its neighbors, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="French nurse"/&gt; France itself is divided between strong Roman Catholic hostility towards euthanasia, as well as mounting pressure from the liberals to decriminalize assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt; This division of pro and con euthanasia is just as visible in the divide between those who supported Christine Malèvre's actions and those who did not. After originally admitting to helping 30 gravelly-ill patients kill themselves, Malèvre received an outpouring of support from both the public and ministers.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt; Malèvre received over 5,000 letters from the public showing support and appreciation for her acts of compassion, and Health minister Bernard Kouchner stated that everyone should avoid hasty moral judgement when it came to Malèvre's case.&lt;ref name="Sage"/&gt; The media was also generally sympathetic toward Malèvre, someone they described as a model nurse who was helping these terminally ill patients end their life of misery for the good of the patient.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; Despite this outpour of success, public opinion seemed to turn against Christine Malèvre when details of the case were leaked by judges and family members that stated the terminally-ill patients that Malèvre had ‘helped’ in ending their own lives neither wanted nor asked Malèvre to aid in their suicide.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt; The main association that supports the right-to-die immediately dropped its support for Malèvre, and public opinion turned quickly against her to now support the prosecutor and lawyer's opinion that Malèvre is not a Madonna of euthanasia and did not help her patients in any way, but rather is a serial killer who murdered these patients to satisfy her own dark compulsions.&lt;ref name="heroine"/&gt;

'''Albert Millet''' (1929–2007) was a [[French people|French]] [[serial killer]], nicknamed "The Boar of the Moors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/le-grand-pere-meurtrier-poignarde-sa-compagne-24-02-2002-2002844969.php "The murderous grandfather stabs his girlfriend"] Article by François Corbara published on 24 February 2002 in ''[[:fr:Le Parisien|Le Parisien]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Albert Millet, The Boar of the Moors" December 11, 2011 and December 16, 2012 in ''[[:fr:Faites entrer l'accusé|Get the Accused]]'' presented by [[:fr:Frédérique Lantieri|Frédérique Lantieri]] on [[:fr:France 2|France 2]]{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Albert Millet, the wild boar of the Moors" November 26, 2014 in ''[[:fr:L'Heure du crime (émission de radio)|L'Heure du crime]]'' of [[:fr:Jacques Pradel|Jacques Pradel]] on [[:fr:RTL|RTL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He killed two women in 1954, then in 1979, and a man in 2007, all in Hyeres.

== Biography ==
Albert Millet was born in 1929 in [[Hyères]].&lt;ref&gt;Didier Fabre, '' The bloody trajectory of Albert Millet, the other Pierrot the madman '', [[:fr:Presses du Midi|Presses du Midi]], October 2011 {{ISBN|2-8127-0283-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood he was beaten by his alcoholic father and abandoned by a fickle mother. He dropped out of school at the age of 14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/albert-millet-meurtrier-jusqu-a-son-dernier-jour-21-11-2007-3291377850.php "Albert Millet, murderer until his last day"] Article by Timothée Boutry published November 21, 2007 in ''[[:fr:Le Parisien|Le Parisien]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He knew about the castle in Hyères which overlooked the city, as well as the [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] which surrounded it. He would take refuge in a particular spot to hide after each of his murders. He performed his military service in [[Tataouine]], [[Tunisia]], and held the position of sniper. He was passionate about weapons.

He distinguished himself very quickly in the court system:

* in 1948 he was twice sentenced to one month's imprisonment for theft;
* in 1948 he was sentenced twice again for theft;
* in 1950, he became involved in theft, gendarme violence{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} and the possession of a weapon of war.

On June 5, 1951, he tried to shoot an Algerian. He was arrested by the police in the ''maquis'' where he had hidden with his rifle.

== Crimes ==
In early 1954, in Hyères, Millet met 15-year-old Paulette Dogliotti at a ballroom. He fell in love with her. Paulette, who was brought up by her aunt, Élisa Maggiorana, was a servant. Millet would wait for her every night in front of her employers' house, when she carried the metal bin to put it on the sidewalk, he would meet her.

Élisa disapproved of Paulette's connection with Millet because of his passion for weapons and the convictions he already had. She also considered Paulette to be too young for the relationship. Élisa then forbade them from socializing, and Paulette agreed with her aunt's decision.

In March 1954, in Hyères, Élisa was drinking in a bar with her fiancé. When Millet entered the bar, he was ordered not to approach Paulette. The conversation escalated, and she slapped him in front of everybody. The fiancé then threw Millet out of the bar. In a calm tone, Millet issued death threats against Élisa and Paulette.

On March 28, 1954, as Paulette took out the trash like normally, Millet pulled out his gun and shot her. She came out miraculously unscathed, the metal bin having served as a shield. Millet then hid in the maquis and Élisa filed a complaint against him.

On April 3, 1954, at around 17:00, Élisa Maggiorana was sitting near the bus stop in front of the ''Aux Dames de France'' store. Millet crossed the street, walked straight towards her and shot her in the head. She died instantly. He again hid in the maquis he knew very well, gaining on this occasion the nickname "The Wild boar of the Moors".

The police finally found him the next day at the station. He was shot three times in the skull, falling into a coma, but miraculously surviving.

His nickname "Pierrot" comes from the analogy with [[Pierre Loutrel]].

=== Trial, conviction and incarceration ===
On September 30, 1955, the trial of Albert Millet began at the cour d'assises in Var, in [[Draguignan]]. The defense of Millet was provided by Master Aymé Perrimond. Millet recognized the facts, but denied premeditation. He claimed to have shot voluntarily in the trash to scare Paulette and argued that as a former sniper, if he had really targeted Paulette, he would not have missed it. Regarding Élisa, he claimed that he wanted her to come with him to the police station to withdraw his complaint. But he got scared when she screamed as soon as she saw him.

Millet was [[sentenced to death]]. He was incarcerated at the [[Baumettes Prison]] in [[Marseille]]. He appealed in cassation, the court of cassation canceled his sentence of death for vice de form.

In 1956, the new trial was held at the cour d'assises of [[Alpes-Maritimes]] in [[Nice]]. Albert Millet was resentenced to [[penal labor]] for life. He was then incarcerated in the [[Fresnes prison]], then the Château-Thierry Prison, and the [[Clairvaux Prison]], prisons in which the conditions of detention were the hardest. During his detention, he behaved like a model prisoner. On July 12, 1968, his sentence was commuted to 20 years of imprisonment.

During his captivity, he maintained a correspondence with the wife of one of his friends, Fernande "Nande" Valentin. She was a caregiver at San Salvadour Hospital. She visited him in the prison parlor. They began a relationship that took shape after the divorce of Fernande.

=== Liberation and renewed crimes ===
On July 10, 1973, Albert Millet received parole.

In August 1973, as promised, he married Fernande. They then moved to 5th de la Croix Street in Hyères. He said that Fernande was "a saint". He only touched guns when he went hunting. The two grooms were happy together. Fernande impeccably kept the focus. Millet, however, had very little to do with housework, did not have a job, but did small, undeclared gardening work. Every month, he respected his obligation and pointed to the police station to sign his residence permit.

The evening after her work in the hospital, Fernande performed households to supplement the income, the household not rolling on the gold. Over the years, Millet became possessive, suspicious, spied on Fernande and suspected her of having a lover. For her part, she complained that he wanted to have [[sex]] too often and that he prevented her from sleeping.

After 22:00 on June 12, 1979, Fernande told him she did not want him to sleep in the bed, but on the couch. She told him that she did not want to take care of a husband who does almost nothing. As she did not want him to find himself destitute after separation and still holding on to him, she signed him a check for 20,000 [[francs]] for him to make a fresh start. Millet felt humiliated.

At 5:00 on June 13, 1979, Millet stabbed Fernande with a dagger with two swings to the heart. Millet barricaded himself in the house and got drunk. A little after 9:00, he was totally drunk and fired in all directions through the window of his room. The house was quickly surrounded by police. He threw objects out the window. He confessed his crime to the police, shouting "I killed a saint", and said that he wanted to commit suicide. After about four hours of negotiations with friends and the priest, Millet finally surrendered to the police.

In custody, Millet declared that after killing his wife, he decided to commit suicide in the bush with his pistol. He took his doberman on a walk. But on the way he changed his mind and hit the bitch, who ran away. While in police custody, he asked to speak to the Commissioner, whose office was on the second floor, and tried to commit suicide by jumping from the landing into the police station's stairwell. The police caught him in flight on the first floor. As part of the investigation, the police requested the opening of Fernande's locker at the hospital where she worked. The latter found drafts of a letter that was not addressed to Millet, but to an unfaithful lover, suggesting that Millet must have felt that his wife was cheating on him.

A few days later, the corpse of a Doberman was discovered with a stone around his neck in a well by a shepherd who hid his discovery, for fear of Millet.

=== Trial, conviction and incarceration ===
On May 11, 1981, Albert Millet's trial began at the cour d'assises of Var in Draguignan. Fernande's family claimed that it was not logical for the bitch to run away - she would have taken refuge at home, and she would have defended her mistress if she had seen Millet hurt her. They were convinced that the defendant killed the dog before, and therefore that he had premeditated the murder of Fernande and that the crime was therefore an assassination.

Millet, who plead guilty to the crime of passion, was sentenced to life imprisonment, the jury having not retained the premeditation. He again was a model inmate. His sentence was finally commuted to 22 years of imprisonment. He did not benefit from any psychological support. He worked during his detention, and was saving about 300 000 francs at the time. He also enjoyed exit permits, during which he stayed in a room of a small hotel in Nice.

In June 2001, during his fourth leave, he met a woman named Gisèle on the terrace of a café. He confessed to her all his criminal career. She told him that she only has a disability pension as income, that she spent it at the casino and that she was in debt. She invited him to spend the night, at 3rd avenue du Patrimoine, in the small two-room apartment that she owned.

=== Release ===
In December 2001, Albert Millet was released on parole. He then left to live in Gisèle's apartment. According to her, he had great sexual needs, which she appreciated at first. He also did the housework. He gave her many gifts (jewelry, clothes, etc.), and large sums of money.

Millet's probation officer worried about the speed with which his savings were disappearing and feared he was being scammed. Millet replied that he was fully aware of this and that he was quite willing. Millet contacted Master Thierry Perrimond, the son of his first lawyer, Aymé Perrimond, who died during his detention. Millet entrusted his personal fortune ([[louis d'or]], watches, jewels, etc.) to his lawyer, who placed it in the vault of a bank in [[Toulon]]. After a small fright due to the opening of a bad locker, Master Thierry Perrimond restored his property.

Gisèle quickly found Millet to be possessive and she felt watched by him. She told in a letter that he must leave home, and that their relationship will end on February 15, 2002. Millet tried to coax her by saying that he had hidden a treasure in the maquis near Hyères, including between other twelve gold bars. He offered to give her most of it, in exchange for staying with him. She asked to see this treasure before giving an answer.

On February 12, 2002, they went by train to Hyères. Millet had bought an [[ice axe]]. A taxi dropped them at the Fenouillet road, in a deserted place that Millet said is the one where he hid his treasure. He began to scratch the ground behind the rocks with his ice axe. Gisèle realized that he can easily kill her discreetly here and panicked, returning to the road and stopping the first car. The driver took Albert and Gisèle to the station from where they left for Nice, where she abandoned Millet.

On February 13, 2002, Millet recontacted Gisèle and offered her 10,000 francs to return to live with him. She accepted, but on February 17, 2002, she told him to leave permanently. He still spent the night at home.

In the early morning of February 18, 2002, Gisèle was in bed when Millet hit her with a kitchen knife. They fought and she was cut under the chin. Millet tried to rescue her, but she told him to leave, which he did. She called an ambulance which took her to the Saint Roch hospital. Her injury was not serious. Millet soon went to the hospital to check on Gisèle, then surrendered himself to his probation officer. He said he never intended to kill Gisèle.

=== Trial, conviction and incarceration ===
The trial of Albert Millet for the attempted murder on Gisele took place in the [[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|tribunal correctionnel]]. The defense of Millet was provided by Master Mireille Damiano, Master Sandrine Setton being the lawyer of Gisèle. Millet was sentenced to seven years in prison, but appealed his conviction. At the trial on appeal, his conviction was confirmed.

=== Release, last murder and suicide ===
In August 2007, Albert Millet was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.draguignan.maville.com/actu/actuphoto.php?idCla=12357&amp;idDoc=468901&amp;idPho=704636&amp;prov= «Hyères: Albert Millet commits suicide after one last murderous madness»] Article published on November 20, 2007 in ''[[:fr:Nice-Matin|Nice-Matin]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He had 30,000 [[euros]] in savings. He moved to room 4 of the Hotel du Soleil in Hyères. He met his neighbor Chantal, who lives at 1st Neuve Street. He saw her from the window of her hotel room. Chantal was depressed and had financial worries. He eventually moved to her home and paid a portion of the rent. He gives her presents and invited her to eat at a restaurant. But Millet was upset, because Chantal had a friend who came almost every day to their apartment, Christian Fernandez, 41-years-old. She offered him an aperitif and the meal while it is Millet who financed. They argued about it. Millet went back to his room at the hotel and decided that Chantal must repay some of his money, several thousand euros.

On November 18, 2007, Millet spent the night at Chantal's house and insisted that they be alone. Chantal refused and invited Christian. Millet went to bed but got up to complain about the noise, which was reclined several times in a row.

On November 19, 2007, at 3:00 am, Millet got up and went down to the first floor. Christian invited him to have a drink with them. Millet, insulted, left the house saying that he would come back armed. Christian, however, did not take his threat seriously. A little later, Millet knocked on the door of the house and calmly asked to enter. Chantal opened the door, and Millet bursted in, shooting her in the thigh. Christian intervened, but was shoot three times and died on the spot. Millet fled and hid in the bush. But the "Boar of the Moors" had aged and could no longer evade the gendarmes. At around 4:45 pm, in the climb of Noailles, Millet saw the policemen and committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.

'''Catherine Monvoisin''', or '''Montvoisin''', [[née]] ''Deshayes'', known as "'''La Voisin'''" (c. 1640 &amp;ndash; February 22, 1680), was a [[France|French]] [[fortune teller]], commissioned poisoner, and professional provider of alleged sorcery.  She was the head of a network of fortune tellers in Paris providing poison, aphrodisiacs, abortion, purported magical services and the arranging of [[black mass]]es, with clients among the aristocracy, and became the central figure in the famous [[Poison affair|''affaire des poisons'']]. Her purported organization of commissioned [[black magic]] and poison murder was suspected to have killed 1000 people, but it is believed that upwards of 2500 people might have been murdered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Ramsland, Katherine (2005) ''The Human Predator.'' The Berkley Publishing Group, New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Catherine Deshayes married Antoine Monvoisin, who was active as a jeweler and a silk merchant with a shop at Pont-Marie in Paris.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"&gt;The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide, and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV (St. Martin's Press (October 12, 2003) {{ISBN|0-312-33017-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

When her husband's trade business led to bankruptcy, La Voisin supported the family by practicing chiromancy and face-reading. In addition to being a fortune teller, she was also active as a midwife, which developed into providing [[abortions]].&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;  Her business as a fortune teller gradually developed into manufacturing and selling purported magical objects and potions,  arranging black masses and selling aphrodisiacs and poison to profit from her clients' wishes upon their future.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

From the late 1660s, La Voisin had become a wealthy and famous fortune teller with clients among the highest aristocracy of France. Among her clients where [[Olympia Mancini, Countess of Soissons|Olympia Mancini, comtesse de Soissons]]; [[Marie Anne Mancini|Marie Anne Mancini, duchess de Bouillon]]; [[Elizabeth, Countess de Gramont|Elizabeth, comtesse de Gramont]], and [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg]].

She resided at the Villeneuve-sur-Gravois, where she received her clients all day, and entertained the Parisian upper class society at parties with violin music in her garden at night.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   La Voisin regularly attended service at the church of the Jansenist abbé de Sant-Amour, principal of the [[Paris University]], and the godmother of her daughter was the noblewoman Mme de la Roche-Guyon.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

She supported a family of six, including her husband, her mother and her children.  She was known to have at least six lovers: the executioner Andre Guillaume, Monsieur Latour, vicomte de Cousserans, the count de Labatie, the alchemist Blessis, the architect Fauchet and the magician Adam Lesage.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;    At one point, Adam Lesage tried to induce her to kill her husband, but while he was initially successful, she changed her mind and aborted the process.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

La Voisin was interested in science and alchemy and financed several private projects and enterprises, some of them concocted by con artists who tried to swindle her.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   She was known to suffer from alcoholism, was apparently abused by Latour, and engaged in several conflicts with her rival, the poisoner [[Marie Bosse]].&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

===Abortion provider===

La Voisin apparently started to include abortions, illegal at the time, for profit within her services as a midwife, and her clients eventually included wealthy members of the aristocracy.  She had a network of abortion providers working for her, notably [[Catherine Lepère]], who stated that she received her clients from La Voisin, who referred clients to her and took the majority of the profit as fee.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

[[Marie Bosse]] claimed that fetuses, who had been aborted late in the pregnancy, were burned in a furnace at the house of La Voisin and buried in the garden of La Voisin, but as Louis XIV gave the order that the part of La Voisin's enterprise which had to do with abortions should not be pursued further, this part of her business is the least investigated and unknown one, and the claims of Marie Bosse therefore remain unconfirmed.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

===Fortune telling===

La Voisin later said that as a fortune teller she had merely used and developed what God had given her.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;
She stated that she was taught the art of fortune telling at the age of nine, and that after her husband became ruined, she decided to profit by it.

She developed her art by studying the modern methods of physiology, and the art of reading the client's future by studying their faces and hands.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

She spent a great deal of money in order to provide an atmosphere which would make her clients more inclined to believe her prophecies: for example, she had a special robe of crimson red velvet embroidered with eagles in gold made for a price of 1,500 livres to perform in.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

In 1665 or 1666, her divination was questioned by the Congregation of the Mission at the Saint Vincent de Paul's order and she was called for questioning, but La Voisin defended herself successfully before the professors at [[Sorbonne university]] and was allowed to continue her business as a fortune teller.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

===Professional sorcery===

Her business as a fortune teller gradually developed in to a business of professional alleged [[black magic]]. During her activity as a fortune teller, she noticed similarities among her clients wishes about their future: almost all wanted to have someone fall in love with them, that someone would die so that they might inherit, or that their spouses would die so that they might marry someone else.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

La Voisin decided to profit financially off of her clients' wishes by offering services of purported magic to make their wishes come true.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   Initially, she told her clients that their wish would come true if it was also the will of God.  Secondly, she started to recommend to her clients some action that would make their dreams come true.
These actions were initially to visit the church of some particular saint; then she started to sell [[amulets]], and gradually, she recommended more and more alleged magical objects or rituals of various kinds.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

For those clients who wished for someone to fall in love with them, she manufactured love powders: the bones of toads, the teeth of moles, [[Spanish fly]], iron filings, human blood and ''[[mummia|mummy]]'', and the dust of human remains were among the alleged ingredients of the love powders concocted by La Voisin.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

Finally, her most radical and expensive recommended practices were the [[black mass]], which she arranged for clients for profit, during which the client could pray to Satan for their wish to come true.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   During at least some of these masses, a woman performed as an altar, upon which a bowl was placed: a baby was held above the bowl, and the blood from it was poured into the bowl.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}  Whether the baby in question was actually killed on this occasion, or whether the baby was already dead by natural causes, such as being stillborn, could vary.

She had several associates working for her arranging and participating in her professional magic services, notably [[Adam Lesage]], who performed alleged magical tasks; and the priest [[Étienne Guibourg]] and abbé Mariotte, who officiated at the black masses.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

===Poison commission===

La Voisin finally took the step from purported magical potions, amulets and rituals to selling [[aphrodisiacs]] to those who wished for someone to fall in love with them, and fatal poison was given to those who wished for someone to die.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

The art of poisoning had become a regular science at the time, having been perfected, in part, by [[Giulia Tofana]], a professional female poisoner in Italy, only a few decades before La Voisin. La Voisin provided a large variety of poisons for her clients and had a network of poison providers working for her, notably the apothecary [[Catherine Trianon]].&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

Her knowledge of poisons was apparently not so thorough as that of less well-known sorcerers, or it would be difficult to account for [[Louise de La Vallière]]'s immunity.

===Connection to Madame de Montespan===
[[File:Messenoire.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Catherine Monvoisin and the priest Étienne Guibourg are shown performing a [[black mass]] for Madame de Montespan (lying on the altar) in an 1895 engraving by Henry de Malvost.]]

The most important client of La Voisin was [[Madame de Montespan]], official royal mistress to King [[Louis XIV of France]]. Their contact were often performed through the companion of Montespan, [[Claude de Vin des Œillets]]. Montespan was alleged to have hired La Voisin in 1667 to arrange a black mass. This mass was celebrated in a house in Rue de la Tannerie. Adam Lesage and abbé Mariotte officiated, while Montespan prayed to win the love of the king.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;    The same year, Montespan became the official mistress of the King, and after this, she employed La Voisin whenever a problem occurred in her relationship with the King.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

In 1673, when the King's interest in Montespan seemed to wane, Montespan again employed La Voisin, who provided a series of black masses officiated by [[Étienne Guibourg]]. On at least one occasion, Montespan herself acted as the human altar during the mass.&lt;ref name=summers&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uV_kQksWgCoC&amp; ''Geography of Witchcraft''] by [[Montague Summers]] (1927; reprint [[Kessinger Publishing]], 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; La Voisin also provided Montespan with an aphrodisiac, with which Montespan drugged the King. During the King's affair with [[Anne de Rohan-Chabot|Madame de Soubise]], Montespan used an aphrodisiac provided by Voisin's colleague [[Françoise Filastre]] and made by Louis Galet in Normandy.

In 1677, Montespan made it clear that if the King should abandon her, she would have him killed. When the King entered into a relationship with [[Angélique de Fontanges]] in 1679, Montespan called for La Voisin and asked her to have both the King and Fontanges killed.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;     La Voisin hesitated, but was eventually convinced to agree. At the house of her colleague, Catherine Trianon, La Voisin constructed a plan to kill the King together with the poisoners Trianon, Bertrand and [[Romani (adventurer)|Romani]], the last being the fiancé of her daughter.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;     Trianon was unwilling to participate and tried to make her change her mind by constructing an ill-fated fortune for her, but Voisin refused to change her mind. The group decided to murder the King by poisoning a petition, to be delivered to his own hands.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

On 5 March 1679, La Voisin visited the royal court in Saint-Germain to deliver the petition. That day, however, there were too many petitioners and the King did not take their petitions, which foiled her plan. Upon her return to her home in Paris, she was castigated by a group of monks. She handed the petition to her daughter [[Marguerite Montvoisin]] and asked her to burn it, which she also did. The next day, she made plans to visit Catherine Trianon after mass, to plan the next murder attempt upon Louis XIV.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

=== Arrest ===

The death of the King's sister-in-law, the [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|duchesse d'Orléans]], had been falsely attributed to poison, and the crimes of [[Madame de Brinvilliers]] (executed in 1676) and her accomplices were still fresh in the public mind. In parallel, a riot took place where people accused witches of abducting children for the black masses, and priests reported that a growing number of people were confessing to poisoning in their confessions.

In 1677, the fortune teller [[Magdelaine de La Grange]] was arrested for poisoning, and claimed that she had information about crimes of high importance. The arrest of the successful fortune teller and poisoner [[Marie Bosse]] and [[Marie Vigoreaux]] in January 1679 made the police aware that there existed a network of fortune tellers in Paris who dealt in the distribution of poison.

On 12 March 1679, La Voisin was arrested outside [[Notre-Dame de Bonne-Nouvelle]] after having heard mass, just before her meeting with Catherine Trianon. In April 1679, a commission appointed to inquire into the subject and to prosecute the offenders met for the first time.  Its proceedings, including some suppressed in the official records, are preserved in the notes of one of the official court reporters, [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]].

===Investigation and trial===

At the arrest of La Voisin, her maid Margot stated that the arrest would mean the end of a number of people in all levels of society.  La Voisin was imprisoned at Vincennes, where she was subjected to questioning. On 27 December 1679, Louis XIV issued an order that the whole network should be exterminated by all methods regardless of the rank, sex, or age. The arrest of La Voisin was followed by the arrest of her daughter [[Marguerite Monvoisin]], Guibourg, Lesage, Bertrand, Romain and the rest of her network of associates.

La Voisin was never subjected to torture: although a formal order was issued giving permission for the use of torture, it was made clear that the order was not to be put in effect, and consequently it was never made use of.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   The reason it suggested to have been the fear that she might reveal the names of influential people if she was questioned under torture.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   Aware of her alcoholism, however, her interrogators reportedly did not limit her access to alcohol but instead kept her in a state of drunkenness during her interrogations.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;  Her confrontations with other accused, particularly those with Adam Lesage and Marie Bosse, was especially effective.  Initially, she claimed to have referred all those clients wishing to buy poison to Marie Bosse.  In March, however, she named [[Marguerite Leféron]] and [[Francoise de Dreux]] as clients, and the 10 October, she admitted having sold poison and magical services to several members of the royal court; she also described the development of her career.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

La Voisin denied ever meeting or serving Montespan. She did admit that "Paris is full of this kind of thing and there is an infinite number of people engaged in this evil trade" but refused to mention further clients nor did she mention having arranged or participated in black masses.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;    She once mentioned to the guards that the question she feared most was that they would ask her about her visits to the royal court.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;    It is likely that she was referring to Montespan as her client and her attempt at murdering the King, and that she feared that such a confession should result in her execution for regicide.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;    Her list of clients, the arranging of the black masses, her connection to Montespan and the murder attempt on the King were not revealed until after her death, when it was stated by her daughter and confirmed by the testimonies of her former associates.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

She also denied claims of using her oven to burn the bones of aborted infants that were too large for the grave area in her garden. She also counterclaimed any usage of poisons and that she only possessed purgatives for personal use or her family. Another accusation she denied includes injecting syringes with fatal liquids into the bodies of pregnant women to "empty" them, which the aborted fetuses were then subsequently buried in the same manner at the garden grave.&lt;ref&gt;Duramy, Benedetta Faedi. "Women and Poisons in 17th Century France," ''Chicago-Kent Law Review'' vol. 87, no. 2 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial and execution===
On 17 February 1680, La Voisin was put on trial, and was convicted of [[witchcraft]] to [[execution by burning]] two days later.  The days following her verdict until her execution, she was formally interrogated under torture, and the official document stated that she was tortured enough to beg for mercy.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;   However, while an official permit of torture was issued, the police was given to understand that the permit was not to be used, and [[Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie]] stated that La Voisin was in reality never subjected to torture.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt; [[Madame de Sevigne]], who observed La Voisin shortly before her execution, described her to be able to move so freely and so seemingly healthy that it did not seem possible for her to have been subjected to torture.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;  These final interrogations did not reveal anything new.

La Voisin was executed in public on the [[Place de l'Hôtel-de-Ville|Place de Grève]] in Paris on 22 February 1680. On her way to her execution, she reportedly pushed away the priest, and when fastened on the stake, she desperately pushed away the hay which was piled up around her.&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

In July, her daughter Marguerite Monvoisin revealed her connection to Montespan, which was confirmed by the statements of the other accused.  This caused the monarch to eventually close the investigation, seal the testimonies and place the remaining accused outside of the public justice system by imprisoning them under a [[lettre de cachet]].&lt;ref name="Somerset, Anne"/&gt;

== Fictional and cultural portrayals ==
===Film===
The part of La Voisin in the 1997 film ''[[Marquise (film)|Marquise]]'' was played by [[Anémone]] (real name Anne Bourguignon).

The part of La Voisin was played by ''[[Suzanne Clément]]'' in the TV series ''[[Versailles (TV series)|Versailles]]'' (2015-ongoing).

===In literature===
La Voisin and her organization has been described in several literary works:

* W. Branch Johnson: "'The Age Of Arsenic'. Being an account of the life, trial and execution of Catherine Montvoison, known as La Voison, and of her vile associates and credulous Clients of both high and low Degree: together with the Relation of their various Transactions in Poison, Abortion, and Black or Satanic Masses, with other Details concerning sundry Manners and Habits of the Times and with but little Moralising thereon: the Whole comprising a curious and momentous Episode in the Reign of King Louis XIV of France" (1932)
* Brad Stieger: 'The Hypnotist' (1979)
* [[Judith Merkle Riley]]: ''The Oracle Glass'' (1994)
* Anne en Serge Golon: ''Angélique en de koning''
*[[Shelby Mahurin]]: ''Serpent &amp; Dove''

===Manga===
ボアザン (''Boazan''), by Takatoo Rui, is a [[manga]] partially based on La Voisin.

===Music===
Belgian black metal band [[Enthroned]] wrote ''Graced by Evil Blood'', based on La Voisin, on their album [[Carnage in Worlds Beyond]].

==See also==
* [[Marie-Josephte Corriveau]], a Canadian woman convicted of murder in 1763, later acquiring a legend and comparison to La Voisin
* [[Giulia Tofana]], another female poisoner, in Italy, only a decade before La Voisin
* [[Marie-Anne de La Ville]]; in October 1702, this person was arrested for having created a new organisation similar to the one of la Voisin, but because of Affair of the Poisons, she and her colleagues were never brought to trial, but imprisoned without trial on a lettre du cachet.

'''Majid Salek Mohammadi''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: مجید سالک‌محمودی) was an [[Iran]]ian [[serial killer]], who killed 24 people between 1981 and 1985.

== Cause of the murders ==
One of the informants on the Mohammadi case said that: "Majid was imprisoned for 2 years for a [[bad check]], and after being released from prison, he became aware of a relationship between his wife and his cousin. It was never clear why these two were spared, but he began to murder any woman whom he considered not loyal to her husband."&lt;ref name=Majid&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zanan.co.ir/social/000368.html |title=Women from within - Serial killings: Women who died, men who died |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022043410/http://zanan.co.ir/social/000368.html |archive-date=2007-10-22 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 24, 1985, the first branch officers of a special unit succeeded in stopping and identifying the green Chevrolet in Tehran's [[Baharestan (district)|Baharestan]] Square.

== Suicide ==
Ahmed Mohagheghi, in his book ''Hunt for the Last Killer,'' described the death of Majid Salek Mohammadi: "At 21:30 on May 8, 1985, when I went into the courtroom, I was messaged to contact the prosecutor immediately. When I came to the prosecutor's office, the guard said that it was as if someone in prison had committed suicide. I received a phone call from the [[Qasr Prison]]. The Major, who headed the case, sounded very annoyed. Majid had killed himself in his cell. And with his death, his case was closed forever."&lt;ref name=Majid/&gt;

'''Johann Mayer''' (born April 2, 1886 in [[Uersfeld]] - December 29, 1923 in [[Cologne]]), nicknamed "Stumpfarm", was a [[Germany|German]] [[serial killer]], who was [[sentenced to death]] for fourfold murder and one [[manslaughter]].

== Life ==
Mayer was born in Uersfeld, the son of [[Gunderath]]-born non-sedentary [[day laborer]] Johann Wilhelm Mayer and his wife Anna Maria (née Knorr). The place of birth in which Mayer was first [[Emergency baptism|baptized]] on his birthday and regularly baptized the next day, was rather coincidental, as his traveling parents did not have a permanent home. As a child Mayer attended the school in [[Boos, Mayen-Koblenz|Boos]], before he started work in a quarry. Due to an accident in the quarry - possibly through careless handling - Mayer lost his left forearm, which earned him the nickname "Stumpfarm", even before his criminal career began. Since then he was only partially able to work as a farmhand and harvest helper.

At the time of the [[First World War]], Mayer, who was incapable of [[military service]], increasingly fell into an unsteady lifestyle. He only did her murder in the woods between [[Elzbach]] and Endert, but was also given penalties for assault, theft and [[poaching]].

== Crimes ==
From March 1918 to May 1919, Mayer killed three women with whom he had previous relationships, as well as two men, with whom he had previously been friends with.

* Maria Dahm from [[Mayen]], 23 years old, murdered between March 18–24, 1918 in the Mayen town forest.
* Maria Falk from [[Bonn]], 28 years old, murdered in February 1919 in the forest between [[Masburg]] and [[Hauroth]].
* Nikolaus Schüller from [[Kalenborn, Cochem-Zell|Kalenborn]], 30 years old, murdered on March 30, 1911 in the forest near [[Mannebach, Vulkaneifel|Mannebach]].
* Lorenz Reuter from Masburg, 22 years old, murdered on April 26, 1919 in the forest district of Etscheid between Boos and Mannebach.
* Katharina Forst from Mannebach-Sickerath, 34 years old widow with three children, who disappeared in May 1919 and whose body was found more than a year later in the forest near [[Illerich]].

As a murder weapon Mayer used a [[carbine]], and in later interrogations, he described the crimes with ''"A shot, a scream, all over."'' To disguise his actions, he separated the heads and limbs of his male victims and exchanged them.

The well-known "Stumpfarm" was investigated on July 9, 1919, but remained undetected working as a farmhand in [[Eulgem]]. However, on August 10, 1922, he was recognized and accosted by vagrants in the Sänger district northwest of the village. The prisoner was first detained in [[Kaisersesch]], then moved to [[Koblenz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{KuLaDig|O-60210-20130131-2|Kurtrierisches Amtshaus and Burgmannenhaus|zusatz=altes Gefängnis „Prison“, „Bulles“, „Büllesje“, heute Heimatmuseum Kaisersesch|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Condemnation ==
Since Johann Mayer did not confess before the Koblenz jury court, he was sentenced to death on February 7, 1923 for fourfold murder and because of the one manslaughter - 15 years imprisonment. A confession was filed by "Stumpfarm" shortly before his execution, after mercy petitions were rejected. The death sentence against Mayer was enforced on December 29, 1923 in the courtyard of the Cologne prison, where he was decapitated by the [[guillotine]].

'''Maurizio Minghella''' (born July 16, 1958 in [[Genoa]]) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[serial killer]], sentenced to life in prison for the murders of ten sex workers in [[Turin]] between 1997 and 2001 when he was on parole for killing five women in his hometown in 1978. He had also been convicted of robbery, kidnapping and escape from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zabijanie sprawiało mu ogromną przyjemność.

== Biography ==
Maurizio Minghella was born in Genoa in 1958, living in [[Val Polcevera]], [[Bolzaneto]] district. When he was six, his mother separated from her husband and took care of the five children by herself. Later, she married to a new man who beat the entire family. Minghella began to deeply hate his stepfather, defining it later, during his first interrogation, with these words:
{{cquote|quote="He was an alcoholic and beat us badly. I hated him a lot, I often dreamed of killing him, pulling a rope around his neck from behind his back.}}
He attended school without being able to pass the second grade, and at age 12 he still attended the first grade. At school he took his companions by their necks and dragged them by their noses or mouths. Leaving school, he began to do small jobs including being a tiler, even though he often stole scooters, motorbikes and cars on the roads of Val Polcevera and the surrounding areas. Minghella was always seen with different girls and had been nicknamed the "[[John Travolta|Travolta]] of Val Polcevera" for his passion towards [[disco]] music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastampa.it/Torino/cmsSezioni/cronaca/200810articoli/8420girata.asp Article by ''La Stampa''] Accessed on October 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He was also passionate about [[boxing]], but was driven away from it after he was beaten in a match.

An event that heavily impacted his psyche was the death of his brother, who died in a car crash.

Following this, Minghella began to develop a morbid attraction for the dead. Reformed by the conscription service for mental disorders, he married in 1977 "by chance, by chance", as he himself declared, 15-year-old Rosa Manfredi, who was dependent on [[psychiatric medication|psycotropic drugs]]. Their marriage was short-lived: Minghella frequently visited prostitutes, and the girl died after a drug overdose after suffering depression and a [[miscarriage]]. This further traumatized Minghella and his fragile personality. In 1978, he visited the psychiatric clinic of the [[University of Genoa]], learning that his IQ was 70.

== The first murders ==
On April 18, 1978, Minghella killed a prostitute named Anna Pagano in Genoa, then hiding her corpse in the [[Sant'Olcese]] [[comune]]. The corpse was found by some shepherds, its head smashed and with a ballpoint pen embedded in the anus. Minghella also tried to misdirect the investigation by writing "Bricato Rose" instead of "[[Red Brigades|Brigate Rosse]]" on the body, committing a spelling error which was immediately noticed by the police.

On July 8, he killed Giusepinna Jerardi in Genoa in the same way and hid the body in a stolen abandoned car. On July 18, he killed 14-year-old Maria Catena "Tina" Alba, whose naked body was found in [[Valbrevenna]] the next day, tied with a [[garrote]] to a tree. On August 22, after a night at the disco, he killed 21-year-old Maria Strambelli, a saleswoman from [[Bari]], whose body was found 3 days after her disappearance in the outskirts of Genoa.

The last victim was 19-year-old Wanda Scerra, a friend of Strambelli, who disappeared on November 28. Her raped and strangled corpse was found in the escarpment that runs along the Genoa-[[Milan]] railway near Genoa.

== First arrest, trial and imprisonment ==
Minghella was arrested on the night between December 5 and 6, confessing to the murders of Strambelli and Scerra, but denying his guilt in the others. Calligraphic expertise was required due to the attempted misdirection on Pagano's body. Both the writing and the pen used to sodomize the victim were connected back to Minghella. For the murder of Alba, a pair of glasses belonging to Minghella were found at the crime scene.

On April 3, 1981, he was sentenced by the [[Assizes]] court of Genoa to [[life imprisonment]] for five homicides, which was to be served at the maximum security prison in [[Porto Azzurro]]. In prison he always proclaimed his innocence and in the eighties also requested a revision of the trial through [[Andrea Gallo]]. In 1995, at the age of 37, he obtained semi-liberty and was transferred to the Vallette prison in [[Turin]]. He entered the recovery community of [[Luigi Ciotti]], and worked as a carpenter for the Abele Group.

== Murders between 1997 and 2001 ==
In March 1997, Minghella killed 53-year-old Loredana Maccario in a woman's home in the Turin neighborhood of San Salvario. She was a sex worker. In May, 20-year-old [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Fatima H'Didou was raped and then strangled with the snare of a tracksuit in [[Caselette]]. She was a sex worker. 

On February 14, 1998, he strangled 29-year-old [[Albania]]n Floreta Islami with a scarf in Rivoli. She was a sex worker. 

On January 30, 1999, he strangled 73-year-old Cosima "Gina" Guido, from [[Taranto]], with a scarf, in her apartment in the center of Turin. On the stairs of the woman's pied-à-terre two pieces of a kitchen towel with organic traces belonging to Minghella were found. She too was a sex worker. 

27-year-old mother of two children Florentina "Tina" Motoc was killed on the night between February 16 and 17, 2001. She bruised brutally to the face and head, with Minghella attempting to get rid of her clothes by starting a small bonfire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chilhavisto.rai.it/dl/clv/Misteri/ContentSet-a7973c35-da5c-4fbc-9eaa-a824ee68c74a.html Tab on Tina Motoc in the Mysteries section of ''Who saw it?'' - Edition 2000/2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the last murder, Minghella's DNA traces, complete or partial impressions found in the places of the crimes, the similar [[modus operandi]] and the time slot in which the murders occurred (all after 5 o'clock), lead to the authorities arresting him.

== Second arrest and trial ==
Minghella was arrested on March 7, 2001, and the victims' cell phones were found with their registration numbers deleted. His own cell phone was traced to the area where Motoc was located at the evening of the crime. Imprisoned in the Vallette prison, he tried to escape from through the laundry in the spring of 2001, but managed to get to the first wall only.

He was transferred to the Biella prison, and on the morning of January 2, 2003, he was hospitalized for chest and arm pain in the town's emergency room, managing to escape from through a bath. Minghella was recaptured at 10 PM the same day near the train station.

Suspected in the murders of tens of victims who had worked as sex workers, but convicted for only four of them, on April 4, 2003 Maurizio Minghella was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Turin Assizes Court for the murder of Motoc and to 30 years for the murders of Guido and H'Didou. He is serving his sentence in  a prison in [[Pavia]].

{{nihongo|'''Hiroshi Maeue'''|前上 博|Maeue Hiroshi|August 8, 1968 – July 28, 2009}}, aka "The Suicide Website Murderer", was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[serial killer]], who lured his victims via the internet and killed three people in 2005.

Maeue suffered from a [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] [[psychosexual]] disorder which translated into being unable to achieve sexual release in the absence of performing an act of strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/jp/shukan/294|title=Suicide website murderer lived out his fantasies|publisher=[[Japan Today]]|date=2005-08-24|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
Maeue entered the [[Kanazawa Institute of Technology]], where he assaulted and attempted to strangle a male friend. He dropped out in 1988. He was later arrested and charged with assault after beating and attempting to asphyxiate a male work associate in 1995. After settling out of court, he was released but fired from his job. In 2001, he was arrested once more for the attempted strangling of two women and sentenced to a year in prison and 3 years of suspended sentence. After being released early on good behavior, he was arrested again for attempting to strangle a junior high school boy, for which he was sentenced to a year and 10 months in prison.

==Suicide website murders==
Maeue murdered three people after his release in 2005. He was convicted of killing a 14-year-old boy, a 25-year-old woman, and a 21-year-old man, all of whom were members of an [[internet suicide|online suicide]] club. He lured his victims by suggesting they meet and end their lives together by committing suicide via a [[Charcoal-burning suicide|charcoal burner in a sealed car]]. However, after a brief conversation, he would strangle them with his bare hands. This brought him sexual pleasure, and he later claimed he developed his desire to kill this way after reading of similar events in a mystery novel as a child. All three of his victims were killed within a span of four months.

==Trial and death==
In his trial, prosecutors called Maeue a "[[lust murder]]er."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070329a3.html|title=Man gets death for murdering suicidal trio|publisher=The Japan Times|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 28, 2007, the Osaka District Court [[capital punishment|sentenced him to death]]. Although his defence team launched an appeal, he accepted the judgment of the court and expressed a willingness to pay for his crimes with his life, retracting his appeal on July 5, 2007. 

On July 28, 2009, Hiroshi Maeue was [[hanging|hanged]] in Osaka, along with 25-year-old condemned criminal [[Yukio Yamaji]].{{cn|date=January 2015}}

{{nihongo|'''Futoshi Matsunaga'''|松永 太|Matsunaga Futoshi|extra=born April 28, 1961}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[serial killer]] who both [[fraud|defrauded]] and [[torture]]d his victims in what is collectively known as the '''Kitakyūshū Serial Murder Incident''' ({{lang|ja|北九州連続殺人事件}}). Matsunaga was convicted of six counts of murder and one count of [[manslaughter]] between 1996 and 1998 and [[death penalty|sentenced to die]] by hanging. He murdered his victims with an accomplice, [[Junko Ogata]], who received a [[life sentence]].

Matsunaga's crimes were so atrocious that most Japanese media were not willing to report the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.rkb.ne.jp/rkb_news/archives/000813.html|script-title=ja:夏樹静子が見た北九州監禁殺人裁判|language=Japanese|publisher=[[RKB Mainichi Broadcasting]]|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2008-06-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jnocnews.jp/news/show.aspx?id=9191|script-title=zh:中国媒体未能报道的日本杀人案背后|language=Chinese|publisher=JNOC NEWS|year=2005|accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Japan Times]]'' reported that prosecutors said "[the case] is without comparison in the criminal history of our country".&lt;ref name="weekly"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/weekly/news/nn2005/nn20050312a5.htm |title=Pair accused of slaying 7 face gallows |publisher=The Japan Times WEEKLY |date=2005-03-12 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several writers, including [[Ryūzō Saki]], published the details of the crimes.

== Early life ==
[[File:Kokura Jp night.jpg|thumb|right|Kokura Kita-ku]]
Futoshi Matsunaga was born in [[Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyūshū|Kokurakita Ward]] of the city of [[Kitakyūshū]] in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], and grew up in [[Yanagawa, Fukuoka|Yanagawa]]. Matsunaga received good grades in school and had a charming personality, but tended to exhibit disciplinary problems. He was transferred to another high school after engaging in a relationship with a junior high school girl. He married at 19 and had a son.

Despite being married, Matsunaga was involved with at least ten mistresses. In October 1982, during his marriage, he became involved with [[Junko Ogata]], one of his former schoolmates from Yanagawa. In 1984, Matsunaga promised to marry Junko, but her mother, Shizumi Ogata, did not approve of the relationship because of Matsunaga's [[violence against women|abuse]] of her daughter. Matsunaga [[rape]]d Shizumi as a result. In 1985, Matsunaga convinced Junko that her family hated her because of a [[suicide]] attempt and persuaded her to move in with him.&lt;ref name=japantimes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20050929a1.html |title=Pair to hang for seven murders |publisher=The Japan Times |date=2005-08-29 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, Matsunaga also purchased a building in which he could operate a [[futon]] business. Afterwards, he began to electrically shock employees on the third floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/kankin/yami/ka_yami_001.htm |script-title=ja:脅しの“原点”電気責め、松永被告２０代から |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date=2002-09-19 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201001934/http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/kankin/yami/ka_yami_001.htm |archivedate=2008-02-01 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matsunaga would sometimes suddenly shout towards other men, saying things like, "There is a spirit behind you! It is sucking away your fortune!" He also made references to religious terms like ''[[saṃsāra]]'' and ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/20080615-2906435/yami/ka_yami_007.htm |script-title=ja:松永被告「奇妙な顔」、宗教的言動で支配 |language=Japanese |publisher=Yomiuri Shimbun |date=2002-09-25 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924041050/http://kyushu.yomiuri.co.jp/news-spe/20080615-2906435/yami/ka_yami_007.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992, Matsunaga had stolen 180 million [[yen]] (about US$2.2 million) through [[fraud]] or [[blackmail]].&lt;ref name="k"/&gt; He and Junko evaded police capture and were put on Japan's [[most wanted list]].

== Murders ==
Matsunaga lived in a [[condominium]] in Kokurakita-ku. His first victim was a married woman with three children. In April 1993, he convinced her to leave her husband and run away with him, telling the woman that Junko was his sister. One of her children died under mysterious circumstances in September 1993. Her two other children went to live with their father and grandfather the following month. During their relationship, Matsunaga defrauded the woman for 11.8 million yen (about US$145,510). She died mysteriously in March 1994, and the police were unable to prove that Matsunaga had killed the woman or her child.&lt;ref name="monster"&gt;{{cite web | author= | script-title=ja:一家惨殺 | publisher=MONSTER | language=Japanese | url=http://www8.ocn.ne.jp/~moonston/ikka.htm | date= | accessdate=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Matsunaga began victimizing Kumio Toraya and his daughter. Kumio had previously confided to Matsunaga about his previous criminal history; Matsunaga used this information to blackmail Kumio. Kumio and his daughter were held captive in Matsunaga's apartment, where Matsunaga tortured him with electric shocks, forced him to eat his own [[feces]], and forced his daughter to bite her father.&lt;ref name="monster" /&gt; Kumio died as a result of this abuse on February 26, 1996. Matsunaga convinced Kumio's daughter that she had murdered her father.&lt;ref name="monster" /&gt; He told Junko and the girl to dispose of the remains, which were thrown into the sea near the Kunisaki Peninsula after being pulverized.

[[File:Beppu Gulf.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The Kunisaki Peninsula (left) and its surroundings]]
Soon after, Matsunaga found another target in a female acquaintance of Kumio. He convinced the woman that he was a graduate of [[Kyoto University]] and promised to marry her. Instead, he defrauded her of 5.6 million yen (about US$69,066). As before, the woman and her daughter were confined to Matsunaga's apartment. The woman escaped by jumping from the second floor in March 1997. She was put into the care of a mental hospital and her daughter was released.

The following month, Junko left for work and did not return. Matsunaga contacted her family, threatening them and blackmailing Shizumi over the 1985 rape. Matsunaga then faked his own suicide, prompting Junko to return, whereupon she was subjected to continued abuse. He also raped Junko's married sister, Rieko. Junko's family gave 63 million yen (about US$777,116) to Matsunaga, after which he held them captive and psychologically controlled them in ways similar to the methods of cult-leader [[Shoko Asahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mm-labo.com/ambookreview/asin2007/4413041208.html|script-title=ja:なぜ家族は殺し合ったのか|language=Japanese|publisher=Mitsuharu Matsumoto Laboratory|date=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 1997, Matsunaga coerced Junko to shock her 61-year-old father, Takashige, to the point of death. When Shizumi's mental state began to deteriorate, Matsunaga commanded Rieko and her husband, Kazuya, to strangle her on January 20, 1998. Several weeks later, he commanded Kazuya to strangle Rieko while their 10-year-old daughter, Aya, held her down. Matsunaga and Junko then confined Kazuya to a bathroom, where he starved to death on April 13, 1998. Matsunaga then forced Junko and Aya to kill Rieko's 5-year-old son, Yuki. During the trial, Kumio's daughter testified that Matsunaga and Junko had tortured Aya with electricity. Junko refuted this testimony, saying the girl's recollections might have been inaccurate because of guilty feelings about committing her first murder. Kumio's daughter strangled Aya on June 7, 1998. Matsunaga and Ogata dismembered and boiled their victims' remains in pots, then finally disposed of them in washrooms or into the sea. Matsunaga blamed the murders on Junko, who, with their two children, were the only survivors in her family.

In July 2000, Matsunaga convinced another woman to go away with him, lured by the prospect of marriage. In August 2001, she gave her twin children to him and Junko. Matsunaga and Junko then convinced the woman to give them 20 million yen (about US$246,580), telling her that they would need the money to bring up her children.

== Arrest and trial ==
Kumio's daughter, who was being held captive, escaped from Matsunaga on January 30, 2002, but Matsunaga found the girl on February 15 and took her back into captivity. He then tortured the girl with electric shocks.&lt;ref name="weekly"/&gt; On March 6, the girl escaped from Matsunaga again and reported the crimes to the police. She was 17 years old. The police arrested Matsunaga and Junko the next day when they tried to retrieve the girl. The twins and the couple's two children were taken into police protection.

The media initially reported only that Matsunaga and Junko had held their victims captive, similar to the case of [[Fusako Sano]], until details of the couple's murders emerged.

The pair were charged with Aya's murder on September 18, 2002; Takashige's murder on October 12, 2002; Shizumi's murder on December 6, 2002; Yuki's murder on January 11, 2003; Kumio's murder on February 3, 2003; Rieko's murder on February 25, 2003; and Kazuya's murder on May 30, 2003. No murder charges were brought against Kumio's daughter. Junko calmly confessed to her part in the murders, but Matsunaga insisted that the women had fabricated their stories about him. Police never recovered any human remains and found no physical evidence, so they relied primarily upon the testimonies of Kumio's and Junko's daughters during the investigation.

On September 28, 2005, a district court in Fukuoka sentenced Matsunaga and Junko to die by hanging.&lt;ref name="japantimes"/&gt; The court tried six cases, but considered that they had not killed Takashige directly, but had only injured him by electric shocks which later resulted in his death.

The pair [[appeal]]ed the verdict. On September 26, 2007, the Fukuoka High Court upheld Matsunaga's original sentence, but Junko's sentence was changed from death to [[life imprisonment]] because Matsunaga had exerted control over Ogata to force her to kill the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/LEAD%3A+Man's+death+sentence+upheld,+woman's+reduced+to+life+in+murders.-a0172103450 |title=Man's death sentence upheld, woman's reduced to life in murders|agency=[[Kyodo News]]|date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki was arrested in 1989 in [[Hachiōji]], Tokyo after being confronted by a father who had found Miyazaki taking nude photographs of one of his young daughters. After Miyazaki was apprehended, it was discovered that he had an extensive collection of [[anime]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] videotapes, causing a [[moral panic]] against ''otaku''. Though psychiatrists diagnosed Miyazaki as having one or more [[personality disorder]]s, he was determined to be aware of his crimes and their consequences, and was sentenced to [[death by hanging]] in 1997. He was executed in 2008.

==Background==
Miyazaki was [[premature birth|born premature]] and had a birth defect where his hand joints were fused together, preventing him from being able to bend his wrists upwards.&lt;ref name=charlest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html|title=The Silencing of the Lambs|author=Charles T. Whipple|access-date=5 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818192957/http://www.charlest.whipple.net/miyazaki.html|archive-date=18 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his deformity, he was ostracized when he attended Itsukaichi Elementary School&lt;!-- Located where?--&gt;, and consequently kept to himself. He attended Meidai Nakano High School in [[Nakano, Tokyo]], and was a star student until his grades dropped dramatically. He was ranked 40 out of 56 in his class, and did not receive the customary admission to [[Meiji University]]. Instead of studying [[English language|English]] and becoming a teacher as he originally intended, he attended a local junior college and studied to become a photo technician.&lt;ref name=charlest/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Miyazaki moved back into his parent's house near his father's print shop, sharing a room with his elder sister. Although Miyazaki's family was highly influential in [[Itsukaichi, Tokyo|Itsukaichi]], where his father owned a newspaper, Miyazaki expressed no desire to take over his father's job. After his arrest, Miyazaki would say that what he really craved was "being listened to about his problems" but believed that his parents, more worried about the material than the sentimental—"would have not heard [him]; [he] would've been ignored".&lt;ref name=lyon&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lyon, Samantha; Dr Daphne Tan|title=Supernatural Serial Killers: What makes them murder?|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281328}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same confession, he said that by this period in his life he had begun to consider [[suicide]].

Miyazaki was rejected by his two younger sisters, and felt he only received support from his grandfather. In May 1988, his grandfather died. This served to deepen his [[depression (mood)|depression]] and isolated him even further.&lt;ref name=lyon/&gt; In an attempt to "retain something from him", Miyazaki ate part of his grandfather's ashes. A few weeks later, one of his sisters caught him watching her while she was taking a shower. When she told him to leave, Miyazaki attacked her. When his mother learned of the incident and demanded that he spend more time working, and less time with his videos, he attacked her as well.&lt;ref name=lyon/&gt;

Between August 1988 and June 1989, Miyazaki [[mutilation|mutilated]] and killed four girls between the ages of four and seven, and [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] [[Necrophilia|their corpses]]. He drank the blood of one victim and ate a part of her hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/serial-child-killer-hanged-as-japan-steps-up-death-penalty-1-1173292|title=Serial child-killer hanged as Japan steps up death penalty|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=17 June 2008|access-date=9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; These crimes—which prior to Miyazaki's apprehension were named the "Little Girl Murders" and later the {{nihongo|Tokyo/Saitama Serial Kidnapping Murders of Little Girls|東京・埼玉連続幼女誘拐殺人事件|Tōkyō Saitama renzoku yōjo yūkai satsujin jiken}}—shocked [[Saitama Prefecture]], which had few crimes against children.

During the day, Miyazaki was, by all accounts, a mild-mannered individual. Outside of work, he randomly selected children to kill. He wrote to the families of his victims, sending them letters recalling the details of his murders. Police found that the families of the victims had something else in common: all received silent [[Nuisance call|nuisance phone calls]]. Miyazaki would not speak a word during these calls, instead simply breathing heavily. If they did not answer Miyazaki’s calls, he would call repeatedly; sometimes their phones would ring up to 20 minutes.

On August 22, 1988, one day after Miyazaki's 26th birthday, Mari Konno, a four-year-old girl, vanished while playing at a friend's house. After failed attempts to find her, Konno's father contacted the police. Miyazaki had led Konno into his black [[Nissan Langley]] and abducted her. He drove westward of [[Tokyo]] and parked the car under a bridge in a wooded area. There he sat alongside the girl for a half-hour before murdering her. He then engaged in sexual acts with the corpse and left her corpse in the hills near his home. He took her clothes with him and departed. He allowed Konno's corpse to [[decompose]] for a while before later returning to remove the hands and feet, which he kept in his closet. These were recovered upon his arrest. He charred her remaining bones in his furnace, ground them into powder, and sent them to her family in a box, along with several of her teeth, photos of her clothes, and a postcard which read: "Mari. Cremated. Bones. Investigate. Prove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McQueen, Victor|title=The World's Worst Serial Killers: Monsters whose crimes shocked the world|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|year=2015|isbn=1784281484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 1988, Miyazaki was driving along a rural road when he spotted seven-year-old Masami Yoshizawa. He offered her a ride, and she accepted. He then drove to the same place he had killed Konno, and killed Yoshizawa. He engaged in sexual acts with the corpse, and took the girl's clothes with him when he departed.&lt;ref name=keller&gt;{{cite book|author=Keller, Robert|title=Beyond Evil|year=2016|isbn=1536507644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 1988, four-year-old Erika Namba was returning home from a friend's house when Miyazaki kidnapped her, forcing her into his car. He drove to a parking lot in [[Naguri, Saitama]], forced her to remove her clothes in the back seat, and began to take pictures of her. After killing her, he tied her hands and feet behind her back, covered her with a bed sheet, and placed the body in his car's trunk. He disposed of the girl's clothes in a wooded area and left the body in the adjoining parking lot. Miyazaki sent a [[postcard]] to her family, assembled using words cut out of magazines: "Erika. Cold. Cough. Throat. Rest. Death."&lt;ref name=keller/&gt;

On June 6, 1989, Miyazaki convinced five-year-old Ayako Nomoto to allow him to take pictures of her. He then led her into his car and murdered her. He covered the corpse with a bed sheet and placed her in the trunk of his car, taking the body to his apartment. He spent the next two days engaging in sexual acts with the corpse, taking pictures of it in various positions, and filming it.&lt;ref name=keller/&gt;

When the body began to decompose, Miyazaki dismembered it, abandoning the torso in a cemetery and the head in the nearby hills. He kept the hands, from which he drank blood and ate part of them. Fearing that the police would find the corpse, he returned to the [[cemetery]] and the hills two weeks later and carried the remains back to his apartment, where he hid them in his closet.

==Arrest==
On July 23, 1989, Miyazaki saw two sisters playing in a park in [[Hachiōji]], Tokyo. He managed to separate the younger of the sisters from the older one, who stayed behind. The sisters' father arrived shortly after to find Miyazaki taking photographs of the younger daughter, who he had convinced to strip nude. The father attacked Miyazaki, but was unable to restrain him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-06-18/japan-confirms-execution-of-cannibal-killer/2475810&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keller /&gt; After fleeing on foot, Miyazaki eventually returned to the park to retrieve his car, whereupon he was arrested by police responding to a call by the father. A search of Miyazaki's two-room bungalow produced 5,763 videotapes, some containing [[anime]] and [[Slasher film|slasher]] films (later used as reasoning for his crimes). Interspersed among them was video footage and pictures of his victims. He was also reported to be a fan of [[horror film]]s, of which he had a collection. Miyazaki, who retained a perpetually calm and collected demeanor during his trial, appeared indifferent to his capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Schoenberger, Karl|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-09-mn-1579-story.html|title=Sordid Serial-Killing Case Exposes the Other Side of Innocence in Japan|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=9 September 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral panic==
The [[News media|media]] called him "The [[Otaku]] Murderer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|title=The Otaku Killer: Miyazaki Tsutomu|author=Oliviera, James|date=3 January 2010|access-date=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107074646/http://scaredyet.net/the-otaku-killer-miyazaki-tsutomu/|archive-date=7 January 2015|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; His killings caused a [[moral panic]] against otaku, accusing anime and horror films of making him a murderer. Various newspapers claimed that Miyazaki had retreated into a fantasy world of manga as a result of his neglected upbringing.&lt;ref name=Kinsella&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinsella|first=Sharon|year=1998|title=Amateur Manga Subculture and the Otaku Panic|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|volume=24|issue=2|pages=308–9|url=http://www.kinsellaresearch.com/new/Japanese%20Subculture.pdf|publisher=Washington University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keigo Okonogi, a [[psychoanalyst]] at [[Tokyo International University]], told the ''Shūkan Post'' that:

{{quote |text=
The danger of a whole generation of youth who do not even experience the most primary two- or three-way relationship between themselves and their mother and father, and who cannot make the transition from a fantasy world of videos and manga to reality, is now extreme.&lt;ref name=Kinsella/&gt;
}}

These reports were disputed. In [[Eiji Ōtsuka]]'s book on the crime, he argued that Miyazaki's collection of pornography was probably added or amended by a photographer in order to highlight his perversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.odn.ne.jp/kamiya-ta/gisi.html|script-title=ja:大塚英志『「おたく」の精神史』～ぼくが中学時代につくった「偽史」について|trans-title=Hideshi Otsuka "Psychical History of Otaku"-"About the "fake history" I made during junior high school"|language=ja|author=Kousetsu Kamiya|access-date=9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, Fumiya Ichihashi, suspected the released information was playing up to public stereotypes and fears about otaku, as the police knew they would help cement a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunfield.ne.jp/~mike/books/nonfiction/crime/author/ichihashi_fumiya/miyazaki.htm|title=Miyazaki Tsutomu Jiken|publisher=Japanese Literature Webring|access-date=9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Kinsella asserts that large collections of manga and videos were typical in the rooms of youths living in the Tokyo area at the time.&lt;ref name=Kinsella/&gt;

==Trial and execution==
The trial began on March 30, 1990. Often talking nonsensically, Miyazaki blamed his actions on "Rat Man", an [[alter ego]] who Miyazaki claimed forced him to kill; he spent time during the trial drawing "Rat Man" in cartoon form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4156285.ece|title=Japanese 'cannibal killer' executed in Tokyo |work=[[The Times]]|date=17 June 2008|access-date=17 June 2008|location=London|author=Lewis, Leo|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60qqMCSKQ?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4156285.ece |archive-date=11 August 2011|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyazaki's father refused to pay for his son's legal defense and committed suicide in 1994.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; 

The seven-year trial focused on Miyazaki's mental state at the time of the murders. Under Japanese law, people of unsound minds are not subject to punishment, and the feeble-minded are entitled to reduced sentences. Three teams of court-appointed expert psychiatrists came to differing conclusions about Miyazaki's ability to tell right from wrong. Two teams determined him to be feeble-minded—one team concluding that he was [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]], the other that he had [[multiple personality disorder]]. A third team found that although Miyazaki had a personality disorder, he was still capable of taking responsibility for his actions.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes1997-04-14"&gt;{{cite news |title=Serial child-killer Miyazaki gets death sentence |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1997/04/14/national/serial-child-killer-miyazaki-gets-death-sentence/ |access-date=27 June 2019 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=14 April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tokyo District Court]] judged him aware of the magnitude and consequences of his crimes and therefore accountable. He was sentenced to death on April 14, 1997.&lt;ref name="JapanTimes1997-04-14"/&gt; His death sentence was upheld by both the [[Tokyo High Court]], on June 28, 2001, and the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court of Justice]] on January 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200601/17/eng20060117_236139.html|title=Japan's Supreme Court upholds death penalty on child killer|work=[[People's Daily]]|location=Beijing|agency=[[Xinhua]]|date=17 January 2006|access-date=9 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivan Dmitrievich Mandzhikov'''&lt;ref group=n&gt; Named 'Sergey' in media sources&lt;/ref&gt; (1965–1993), known as '''The Kazgugrad Monster''', was a [[Soviet]] [[serial killer]] and rapist. Active between 1988 and 1989, he raped and killed students near the [[Al-Farabi Kazakh National University|KazGU University]], dismembering some of the victims' legs post-mortem. The investigation into his crimes was one of the largest-scaled ones in the history of the [[Kazakh SSR]], and following his capture, Madzhikov was quickly sentenced to death and executed.&lt;ref name=wake&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.zakon.kz/63335-po-sledu-krovavogo-monstra.html|title=In the wake of the bloody monster|author=Oleg Gubaydulin|publisher=Zakon.kz|date=August 2, 2005|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Murders==
===Initial killings===
The first girl to fall victim to Mandzhikov was Aizhan Zhumabaeva,&lt;ref group=n&gt; Named 'Aliya' in media sources&lt;/ref&gt; a student in her early 20s from the university's Faculty of History, who disappeared in October 1988.&lt;ref name=mani&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.kazpravda.kz/articles/view/po-sledam-manyaka|title=In the wake of the maniac|author=Marina Mikhailova|publisher=kazpravda.kz|date=February 23, 2018|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been raped and strangled, with her killer [[Glasgow smile|slashing her mouth from ear to ear]] after death.&lt;ref name=horr&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.caravan.kz/gazeta/uzhas-nad-kazgu-kak-ubivali-studentok-88018/|title=The horror over KazGU: how students were killed|author=Oleg Gubaydulin|publisher=Caravan.kz|date=February 28, 2010|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body, hastily covered with snow,&lt;ref name=wake/&gt; was later found by a 6-year-old making snowballs on the outskirts of KazGU, an experience which caused him to be unable to speak for several days. Her clothes had been torn apart, and although her purse was missing, investigators ruled out the possibility of a robbery gone wrong. Her boyfriend and future fiancé at the time, a man named Talgat, was initially suspected of killing her, but was later cleared when his blood group didn't match that of the killer - [[Rh positive]].&lt;ref name=wake/&gt; In a futile effort, police looked into convicted criminals with this matching blood group, but to no avail.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;

A month later, on November 23rd, another student disappared in the same area as Aizhan. This time, it was Razia Beisembaeva,&lt;ref group=n&gt; Named 'Madina' in media sources&lt;/ref&gt; a student from the Faculty of Mechanics who had gone to visit some friends.&lt;ref name=mani/&gt; While passing through the deserted wasteland at night, she was abducted by Mandzhikov, whom threatened her with a knife. He led the crying girl into his basement, Ivan mercilessly raping and strangling her, Ivan proceeded to cut off both her legs and throw them into the river, as well as extensively mutilate the rest of the body.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt; After catching wind of Beisembaeva's sudden vanishing, policemen searched all of the surrounding area, but yet again, failing to locate the body. As a result, the Almaty Department of Internal Affairs requested assistance from the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]].&lt;ref name=wake/&gt;&lt;ref name=love&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://mk-kz.kz/articles/2014/11/12/manyak-lyubil-delat-podarki.html|title=The maniac loved to give presents|author=Vadim Beregovoy|publisher=[[Moskovskij Komsomolets|MK Kazakhstan]]|date=December 11, 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Investigations and suspicions===
Sensing that they had a serial offender on their hands, investigators started interviewing numerous students in an effort to determine if there had been any previous cases. Surprisingly, one female student admitted to being raped even before Zhumabaeva's murder, and in similar circumstances. While returning to her dorm room, she came across a young man who raped under the threat of "gutting her like a pig". Although she survived their encounter, she was unable to remember much about the attacker, only recalling that he appeared to be of European extraction, tall and in his 20s or 30s. Using these clues, the investigators focused on everybody matching said description, including current and former students of KazGU, the homeless and people living in the area. At some point, they even had five operatives dress up as women in an attempt to lure out the killer, without success. Blood tests were administered to every resident of the area, including medical stuff and the police officers themselves.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;

Soon after, Beisembaeva's corpse was discovered in a quarry. While examining the crime scene, police took interest to one morbidly curious onlooker who had watched them work for more than an hour:&lt;ref name=mani/&gt; he was Ivan Mandzhikov, a former [[Voluntary People's Druzhina|druzhinnik]] who lived with his younger sister and mother, had a girlfriend, but had no job and was with a conviction for rape.&lt;ref name=love/&gt; His blood was taken for examination, but forensic experts soon learned that there was no match, as Ivan's blood group was from the second group, not the third. He was released soon after, but much to the surprise of the authorities, he kept returning to them and attempted to "help" them solve the case. In one instance, he complained about a foul smell in his building's basement, but after a thorough examination, no such smell was noted, and police simply brushed it off as their "assistant" being mentally deranged.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;
===Resumption of the murders===
On January 21, 1989, the killings resumed, with the new victim being 18-year-old Gulmira Satpayeva, a student from the Faculty of Geography. Like Beisembaeva before her, she raped, strangled, had her throat slashed and legs dismembered, but this time, Mandzhikov disposed of her body in the wasteland near the university dormitories.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;

Exactly one month after, a 20-year-old student from the Faculty of Mechanics, Gulbaram Malikova, was met with a similar fate. After raping and strangling her, Mandzhikov hid her corpse in the basement of her home on 15 Universitetskaya Street.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;
==Arrest, trial and execution==
In the end, Mandzhikov's own mistakes led to his downfall. On June 28th, the half-drunk Ivan came across a couple, Zhalal Omarova and Berik Bainazarov, who were walking along the [[Vesnovka River]]. He went up to the them, and declared in Berik's face his intentions of having sex with the girl. Before Bainazarov could fight back, he was stabbed with a knife and died on the spot. Mandzhikov then turned his attention towards Zhalal, ordering her to undress. But before he could do anything, a group of passers-by saw that something was going on, and frightened off the killer.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt; Omarova was later interviewed by authorities, and when shown a photograph of Ivan Mandzhikov, she immediately recognized him as the assailant. Police went to his home to arrest him, finding that Ivan was washing his clothes from what appeared to be traces of blood. Despite his refusal to cooperate, he was taken into the police headquarters for interrogation.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt;

Although he was positively connected to the attack on the couple, Mandzhikov categorically denied any and all accusations against him. He took a second blood examination, but this time, the sample was sent to [[Moscow]]. It later revealed that, in fact, Ivan's blood indeed matched that of the "Kazgugrad Monster", but as the Kazakhstani labs lacked the proper technology for analysis, it wasn't properly determined in time. After learning of this new development, Mandzhikov started to confess his crimes. Speaking in a monotonous voice and missing no details, he described he would go out on nightly hunts on the university grounds, looking for potential victims.&lt;ref name=wake/&gt; He also revealed that he gave away all of the victims' jewelry, handbags and other personal items to his sister or girlfriend. When asked why he tried to help in what was essentially a search for himself, Ivan explained that he was simply trying to stave off suspicions from himself.&lt;ref name=love/&gt;

At trial, Mandzhikov was unrepentant and unremorseful of his crimes, but begged for his life to be spared, even attempting to convince the judge that he was insane.&lt;ref name=horr/&gt; A forensic psychiatric exam proved that was not the case, however, and Ivan Mandzhikov was sentenced to death. In 1993, he was executed in Almaty's Detention Center No. 1.&lt;ref name=wake/&gt;

'''Salvatore "Silvio" Mangion''' (born 1965) is the only known [[Malta|Maltese]] [[serial killer]]. He was convicted of killing three elderly pensioners during robberies between 1984 and 1996, receiving [[life imprisonment]] for his crimes. He is currently incarcerated at [[Corradino prison]].&lt;ref name=joke&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-07-04/local-news/Man-On-trial-for-third-murder:-Mangion-made-%E2%80%98serial-killer%E2%80%99-joke-about-his-tattoos-312479|title=Man On trial for third murder: Mangion made 'serial killer' joke about his tattoos|publisher=[[The Malta Independent]]|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
A native of Żejtun, Mangion, also known by his alias "Kalang",&lt;ref name=get&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.maltatoday.com.mt/news/national/2028/serial-killer-silvio-mangion-gets-life-for-1984-murder?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=787cc5310e056a197eaa9cb5b8eba7b6364b06e7-1575113223-0-AZMTP77qAPIg39QWMuhMmBari9xmbfuObeHw4T8RTs2yMsDf_Sgan7st9tFLfO4s9km2yzZC02qm8Crk8cc9KXaQBJdMJvRq9Eo2bH2FbM_mABM2FzJFDaKv5g3c9Qd0McImj1yuXNpkjutZVgohNpDXtCi-Jco_ijOYfNeACUEHvVkjNQjxGwtKoH-UYIC58LyKkkuL9phl_j8CDG0q_gcnd2IUSyMSbDySY24o8jaN3tBNpZFpVs9A2RVEfU8R39-aNvRdQo04eGjotWK7w596t2n_U7YVezaQwg9uoCPV1Y3mqCZiH70MIhebZuNVEr98jmtqyhrq1rliXlIobtuLQHcenI6GnUAlXOwfkU3PZUr9EflIQMdC7veBOUfzS3bIP-JzhKVxe20R2KRI-Bk#.XeJSDZMzbIU|title='Serial killer' Silvio Mangion gets life for 1984 murder|publisher=Times of Malta|date=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an unemployed [[Disorganized schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] who had depressive episodes,&lt;ref name=plead&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/man-pleads-guilty-to-killing-neighbour.132910|title=Man pleads guilty to killing neighbour|author=Claudia Calleja|publisher=[[Times of Malta]]|date=January 6, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also dependant on alcohol and the medicines he was treated with. At the time of the murders, however, it was determined that he was fully aware of his actions and did them by his own volition, the motive always being robbery.&lt;ref name=joke/&gt;

===Rozina Zammit===
On February 8, 1994, the body of the 54-year-old was found at the doorsteps of her home in [[Safi, Malta|Safi]]. Zammit had sustained 37 stab wounds to her neck, chest and abdomen. The motive appeared to be robbery, as a small sum of 200 [[Maltese lira|liri]] were found to be stolen from her home.&lt;ref name=get/&gt;

Mangion confessed to stalking the woman to her home on the day of the murder and knocking on her front door. When Rozina opened, Silvio attacked her and she began shouting. He stabbed her and went to get the money, but, realizing that she had died from her injuries, proceeded to flee the scene.

===Maria Stella Magrin===
On October 30, 1986, 68-year-old Magrin, who lived only a few doors down from former President [[Ugo Mifsud Bonnici]] in [[Cospicua]], heard a knock on her door and opened without asking who it was. Three men, Mangion and uncle-nephew duo Leli and Oswaldo Spiteri, entered into the house and demanded that she gave them all her money. Maria guided them through the house with a torchlight, as there was no electricity, and handed them a sum of around 15,000 [[Euro]]. Magrin was then stabbed 13 times by Mangion, to prevent identification, as none of the criminals had worn masks, before all of them left. She later died from her injuries.&lt;ref name=joke/&gt;

===Francesco "Frenc" Cassar===
On August 16, 1998, Silvio decided to rob his neighbors: 71-year-old Giuseppa and 75-year-old Francesco "Frenc" Savario Cassar. After he swallowed some pills and drank some pills to pluck up courage, he rang the Cassars' doorbell, surprising Giuseppa with a knife when she opened the door. He stabbed her in the stomach and right arm, but she managed to fight back, calling upon her brother for help.&lt;ref name=plead/&gt; Mangion saw Francesco and lunged at him, fatally stabbing him in the chest. When he saw the Cassar lying bleeding on the ground and his T-shirt covered in blood, he got frightened and fled, disposing of his knife and T-shirt in a reservoir at President Anton Buttigieg Street.&lt;ref name=plead/&gt;

==Trial, imprisonment and confessions==
Some time after the Cassar murder, Mangion was arrested and soon indicted. During a November 26, 2002 hearing, jurors determined that he was sawn at the time of the murder, and on January 5, 2004, at the beginning of his jury trial, he pleaded guilty. Mangion was given a 21-year sentence for killing Frenc and attempting to kill Giuseppa.&lt;ref name=plead/&gt;

The other murders remained a mystery until a year after Mangion's conviction, when he implicated himself as the one responsible to several inmates at [[Corradino prison]],&lt;ref name=get/&gt; one of them being Steven Spiteri. Steven later reported those claims to the police, and Silvio was questioned on their validity, to which he confessed. He also implicated the Spiteris, but, by then, Leli had already died in 2000 and Oswaldo had committed suicide, hanging himself while in custody.&lt;ref name=joke/&gt; Silvio was asked to walk the investigators through the crime scene, explaining the layout accurately. At some point during the trial proceedings, one inspector inquired about two peculiar tattoos Mangion had on each ear: one had the letter 'S', while the other had a 'K'. In response, the murderer joked that it stood for 'serial killer'. On June 23, 2010, Silvio Mangion was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Rozina Zammit,&lt;ref name=joke/&gt; and was given another life sentence for the murder of Maria Magrin at a later date.

'''Andrea Matteucci''' (born 24 April 1962 in [[Turin]]), known as the '''"Monster of Aosta"''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] criminal and serial killer who committed four murders in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Biography ==
Matteucci was born in Turin. His father, a worker with a criminal record for theft and receiving stolen goods, abandoned the family the year his son was born. His mother, Maria Pandiscia, left Andrea in custody of her sister Lina, in [[Foggia]]. At the age of 5, he moved with his mother to [[Aosta]], in a religious institute where he lived until he was 9 years old. When questioned about his mother, Andrea said: "She was a prostitute and she let me attend meetings with her clients. I hate women who get paid to be with men."&lt;ref name=Andrea&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.gqitalia.it/underground/2015/06/05/andrea-matteucci-il-mostro-di-aosta/|title=The disqueiting parable of Andrea Matteucci, the monster of Aosta|author=Edoardo Montolli|publisher=Gqitalia.it|date=5 June 2015|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14, he tried to rob the butcher's shop where he worked at, but a week later he confessed to the act. From 14 to 18 he remained in the community, subsequently leaving to work as a mechanic in [[Quart, Aosta Valley|Quart]].

== Murders ==
[[File:Teatro romano Aosta, 5.JPG|thumb|left|The Roman Theatre of Aosta, site of the 30 April 1980 murder]]
On the evening of 30 April 1980, when he left home, Matteucci met the merchant Domenico Raso at the [[Roman Theatre, Aosta|Roman Theatre of Aosta]]. The man, secretly a homosexual, made sexual advances and to defend himself, Matteucci killed him with a boy scout's knife. Raso had a family, and this led Andrea to believe that he had done the right thing because "a man can not do certain things":&lt;ref name=Andrea/&gt; his mental state was altered, believing that those who have family and engage in extramarital sexual acts do not deserve to live.

Matteucci was not discovered by the investigators and a few months after the crime he left for military service, during which he asked to enter the [[Paratroopers Brigade Folgore|Folgore]] in [[Livorno]]. He left in 1983, with the rank of major corporal. In the same year, he got married and settled in [[Villeneuve, Aosta Valley|Villeneuve]], where he found a job as a shop assistant in a grocery store. In 1987, he had his first child and started working as a stonemason, first under various firms and then in his own workshop in [[Arvier]]. Meanwhile, his relationship with his wife began to deteriorate.

One evening in 1992, Matteucci met Turin prostitute Daniela Zago in [[Brissogne]]. The two had a quarrel while having sex, resulting in Andrea shooting her in the head. Zago did not die immediately and asked Matteucci to take her to the hospital; he pretended to accept her plea, before taking her to an isolated location where he shot her in the head again, killing her. He then buried the corpse not far from the crime scene, in Arvier. After a month, fearing that the remains can be discovered, he dug them up and burned them at a landfill.
[[File:Villeneuve Borgo2.JPG|thumb|Villeneuve and the bridge over the Dora Baltea from which the ashes of prostitute Clara Omoregbee were thrown]]

In 1994, he met the [[Nigeria]]n prostitute Clara Omoregbee in [[Chambave]], engaging in [[sexual intercourse]] with her near [[Arnad]]. Not satisfied with the performance, Matteucci argued with her, hit the woman with his fists and killed her by shooting her twice, once in the head. After this, he [[necrophilia|had sex with her corpse]]. Back home, he dissected the corpse with a kitchen knife, after having burnt the remains in Arvier, throwing them into the [[Dora Baltea]] river near Villeneuve.

On 10 September 1994, while searching for victims in [[Nus]], Matteucci met prostitute Lucy Omon and took her home. After having sex with her, he promised to take her back to Nus by car; instead he took her to Arvier, to his old stonemason's workshop, where he tried to suffocate her with a pillow and a rag. Omon managed to escape from the car.

In 1995, he was convicted of car theft. Taking advantage of the benefit that he was not incarcerated, but it was imposed on him that he had an obligation to sign in [[Saint-Pierre, Aosta Valley|Saint-Pierre]] and being forbidden to move outside of the perimeter between Arvier and Aosta. On 12 May 1995 he killed [[Albania]]n prostitute Albana Dakovi. After having sexual intercourse with her, Matteucci took her to Arnad, where he killed her by hitting her with a wrench and then stabbing her. He then hid the body in his van, with which he then went to Saint-Pierre to sign the register. Like the previous victims, Dakovi's remains were burned.

== Arrest and conviction ==
Dakovi's pimp sent an anonymous letter to the [[Pont-Saint-Martin, Aosta Valley|Pont-Saint-Martin]] barracks where he claimed to have seen the girl enter into a [[Iveco Daily]] van, also writing down the license plate number. On 26 June 1995 Matteucci was arrested in connection with the disappearance, but denied killing Dakovi. The next day, when he was questioned again, he admitted to killing her, immediately confessing to the other murders as well.

During the trial, the psychiatric examination to which he was subjected declared Matteucci "socially dangerous" and partially incapable of understanding and wanting. On 16 April 1996 he was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment and 3 years in a judicial psychiatric hospital by the Court of Assizes of Aosta. He left prison in March 2017 at the age of 55, entering a psychiatric health facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/03/12/edizioni/aosta/il-ritorno-a-casa-di-mister-hyde-vJitrJE0gnvxx6CeQLSRJI/pagina.html|title=The return home of "Mister Hyde"|author=Stefano Sergi|publisher=Lastampa.it|date=2 March 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raúl Osiel Marroquín Reyes''' (born on September 1, 1980 in [[Tampico]]), also known as '''El Sádico''', is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] kidnapper and [[serial killer]] responsible for six kidnappings, four of which ended in murder, in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226070959/http://www.pgr.gob.mx/cmsocial/coms06/260106.htm|title=Press release of the PGR on the capture of Raúl Osiel Marroquín|author=Génaro García Luna|date=26 January 2006|accessdate=26 February 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an organized killer, motivated by hate and discrimination. All his victims were homosexual men, for which he has become a symbol for [[homophobia]] in Mexico.

==Life before the crimes==
Born to parents Roberto Marroquín and Gloria Reyes, Raúl spent one year as a military doctor and was a member of the Mexican army for four years, holding the rank of First Sergeant, but was then discharged.

He was admitted as a private soldier on January 21, 1999, enrolling in the 15th Infantry Battalion in his hometown, where he reached the rank of Second Sergeant. Raúl wanted to advance in the militia and study medicine, but the lack of financial resources forced him to resign. In May 2004, he was discharged from the army and returned to Tampico, where he was eventually imprisoned for 14 months because of a violent robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobic Hate, crime and justice 1995–2005|author=Fernando Del Collado|publisher=Tusquets|isbn=978-970-699-170-6|language=Spanish|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Victims==
===Modus operandi===
Marroquín would approach his victims (whom he met at a famous gay bar, the ''Cabaretito Neón'', located in Zona Rosa, Col. Juárez, Cuauhtémoc delegation of Mexico City), with sentimental and/or erotic proposals; he invited them to his house located at 4223 Av. Andrés Molina Enríquez, Col. Asturias, Venustiano Carranza delegation, or to a hotel; where, depending on whether he had the economic resources, would kidnap them or not. He was aided by accomplice Juan Enrique Madrid Manuel.

He would torture his victims (hence his nickname) by suffocating them until they lost consciousness, and once they returned to their senses Marroquín would suffocate them again and again, until he finally killed them.

When he asked the victim's relatives to help their loved one, regardless of whether they paid or not, Raúl would murder his hostage either by suffocation or strangulation. Later, he left the corpses, which were in suitcases, around different parts of the city.&lt;ref name=mexico/&gt;
===Murdered===
*Jonathan Razo Ayala was kidnapped on October 27, 2005 and murdered on November 12, after 16 days in Marroquin's house. He requested $5,000 ransom, but the victim's family could not pay.
*Ricardo López Hernández was kidnapped on November 30, 2005. He was held captive for nine days until December 9 when he was murdered by strangulation after Marroquin had taken just over $2,000 ransom.
*Armando Rivas Pérez was kidnapped on December 16, 2005. That same day, even though his ransom was paid, he was murdered.
*Víctor Ángel Iván Gutiérrez Balderas was abducted the same day as Armando Rivas and held hostage for six days. After a ransom of a little over $800, he was killed on December 22.
===Kidnapped===
*Juan Carlos Alfaro Alba: was the first victim of Marroquín, kidnapped on October 21, 2005. He was held captive for about a week in a hotel room, during which he received serious physical and psychological damage. His kidnapper asked the family for a ransom, who paid as quickly as possible; Raúl Marroquín then left his victim tied up in the hotel room, apparently because he hadn't "evolved" yet, settling only for the violence inflicted and the easily earned money, sparing Alfaro's life.
*José Ricardo Galindo Valdés: the penultimate victim was kidnapped by Marroquin on December 13, 2005. Raúl communicated with the scared mother, who implored him to not hurt her son, as the family had no money to pay off the ransom. Perhaps because he had a moral dilemma -  the murderer let Galindo leave, but not before threatening to kill him if he spoke about it.
==Psychiatric profile==
His crimes had many similarities to those of the American homosexual serial killers [[John Wayne Gacy]] and [[Robert Berdella]] the motive being a little different: Gacy murdered his victims due to a repression of his own homosexuality that he projected towards others (he was attracted to them, which he blamed them for) and berdella to vent his frustration on his victims. In contrast, Marroquín, although his crimes also had marked homoerotic features (Marroquín himself declared not to be homosexual),&lt;ref name=AFI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/327542.html|title=It presents to AFI to serial killers of homosexuals|author=Silvia Otero|publisher=The Universal|date=26 January 2006|accessdate=1 June 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; you can see in him a sociopath or psychopath within a framework socio-cultural that, in one way or another, gave him a showcase for its contained violence, directing it towards a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Martín Gabril Barrón (forensic expert) (2011).

After his arrest, Marroquín would declare not to be homophobic (although this assertion would be contradicted by others made by the homicide, in which he refers to homosexuals as "an evil for society") that the main reason homosexual men were his target victims was because these people were easier to hunt; This was the statement he made when questioned about his employer:

'''"... because I did not fight in operations that involved weapons and vehicles, it was enough to go to the places they frequented and they alone approached me, it was easier for me to treat those victims"'''. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jiménez Zapata|first=Carlos|last2=Espinosa Marroquín|first2=Elisa|last3=Castillo Proaño|first3=Raúl|date=1970-01-01|title=La gestión educativa para la inclusión de estudiantes con discapacidad|journal=Tsafiqui|issue=5|pages=66|doi=10.29019/tsafiqui.v0i5.283|issn=1390-5341|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFI/&gt;

He lacked empathy and reified the people around him. After being arrested, he was asked if he did not feel bad for the relatives of the people he murdered (since he had obviously taken all human value from his victims), he replied, "I have never thought about them"&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFI/&gt;

He was reluctant to submit to social norms and this made him prone to deviation and criminality.
He lacked guilt and did not accept responsibility for his actions.
He rationalized his actions and possessed an inflated self-esteem. The clearest example of this was to express that their crimes were a good for society, "I even did a good to the society, because those people make that I spent my childhood..."&lt;ref name=AFI/&gt;

'''«One of my victims was a carrier of HIV, and in a certain way, prevented the spread of the virus ...'''»&lt;ref name=rainbow&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004094532/http://www.tvazteca.com/nota/vengalaalegria/el-asesino-del-arcoiris/2009-08-1411|title=The Rainbow Killer|author=Sergio Sepúlveda|publisher=TV Azteca|date=21 August 2009|accessdate=1 June 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He who justified his actions as correct tells us of his inflated self-esteem, he saw himself as a benefactor of society (an exterminating angel). This also indicates an over-evaluation of oneself (narcissism), which is indicative of a deficient psycho-sexual development and an immaturity of the psycho-affective development; according to Robert D. Keppel and William J. Birnes estó, a psycho-affective development disorder is the main cause of the behavior of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=cold&gt;{{Cite book|title="Cold-blooded|author=Rafael Muñoz Saldaña|date=2010|issn=1665-3629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These statements also speak of a distancing from reality. He believed that his actions had a moral justification, although he was fully aware of the ethical and legal implications of his actions, he thought that before society his crimes were minor and even justifiable. According to Joel Norris, this process (the distancing of reality) corresponds to the first phase of the behavior of a serial killer.&lt;ref name=cold/&gt;

*He was prone to sexual perversions.
*He felt attracted and was in constant search of strong emotions; What also, together with the absence of empathy, self-centeredness and the inability to accept responsibility for his actions, made him prone to deviation, crime and paraphilias.
*He was a megalomaniac. His pathological attraction is clearly seen in the torture he subjected to his victims: by torturing he seeks to break the will of the individual to deprive him of his human quality, and thus to have absolute power over that person.
*He was charismatic, attractive and manipulative.
*He was violent and suffered from explosions of anger.
*He had a parasitic lifestyle.
*His criminal career started him as an assailant, his motivation was monetary (his constant search for intense emotions and his pathological attraction for power (megalomania), were also triggers for his criminal behavior); Later, in the same way motivated by the same factors, it evolved to kidnapping, Marroquin was one of the many people in Mexico who saw in the kidnapping a very lucrative activity (because in many of the cases he had already collected the ransom money before assassinating to his victim), and finally to murder. As a result of his activity as a kidnapper he obtained a total of 109 thousand pesos (just over 10,000 dollars).&lt;ref name=press/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexico&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://incriminarte.blogspot.com/2009/12/mexico-y-sus-asesinos-seriales-en-linea.html|title=Mexico and its serial killers|author=Ricardo Ham|publisher=Samsara|date=2007|accessdate=1 June 2011|isbn=978-970-94259-1-0|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Motive===
Explaining himself, Marroquín said, "I snuffed out four homosexuals that in some way were affecting society." He also says he chose gays as his victims because "they're a bad example for kids".

==Capture and sentence==
He was arrested by the PGR on January 23, 2006 in Mexico City without his accomplice, who was captured in 2013. While Raúl Marroquín was sentenced to 128 years imprisonment on September 4, 2008, he stated after his arrest:
{{cquote|quote=I do not regret what I did ... If I had the opportunity I would do it again, only that I would be more careful not to be caught and not commit the same mistakes that led to my capture ... The only thing that I regretted was so this happening my family now...}}&lt;ref name=rainbow/&gt;

On September 4, 2008, Marroquín and Manuel de Madrid were sentenced to a total of almost 300 years in prison. He is currently serving his sentence in the Santa Martha Acatitla Penitentiary in Mexico City, to which he was transferred in 2010, after having been in the Reclusorio Oriente in Mexico City.
==Media==
In an interview, Marroquín said he was not ashamed of his crimes, but was sorry for what his family was going through. He declared he had recurring dreams of his criminal career "improving" by selecting richer, more famous victims. He said he would definitely kill again and try to be more careful about his methods, avoiding the mistakes that led to his capture.

'''Jorge Humberto Martínez Córtez''' (born 1978) is a supposed [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[serial killer]].

== Biography ==
Jorge Humberto Martínez Córtez is suspected of killing 2 to 3 women between 2011 and 2014, as well as an [[attempted murder]] against another woman which caused serious injuries. All of his victims were his romantic partners.

His murders are organized and motivated by sexual compulsion, committed as part of a group.

==Beginnings==
Alejandro was an orphan.  He was baptized '''Armando Martínez'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/ciudad_juarez/10.html|title=Ciudad Juarez:The Serial Killer's Playground (pg. 10)|author=Michael Newton|publisher=TruTV|accessdate=30 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504235135/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/predators/ciudad_juarez/10.html|archive-date=2012-05-04|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent a portion of his childhood in orphanages in the United States.  During the 1970s, he was adopted by Guillermo Máynez, a [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] business entrepreneur and owner of approximately 20 bars and nightclubs in [[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], and his family, who gave him his surname and changed his name to Alejandro.&lt;ref name="Moreno"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2002/11/04/articulos/51_juarez.htm|title=Alguien muy poderoso, con protección policiaca, tras el impune femicidio en Ciudad Juárez: peritos y activistas|author=Rubén Villalpando Moreno|date=2002|publisher=La Jornada|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crimes==
During the 1980s and 1990s, Alejandro and Melchor, cousins, joined a gang of drug and jewelry traffickers that smuggled contraband into the United States.  Supposedly, they were under the protection of the Chihuahuan government headed by [[Francisco Barrio]].&lt;ref name="Rivera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asesinosenseriebios.blogspot.mx/2009/09/el-depredador-de-ciudad-juarez-mexico.html|title="El Depredador de Ciudad Juárez" (México)|author=Horacio B.

In 1999, two former police officers, Víctor Valenzuela and Ramiro Romero Gómez, of the state and federal police, started a new department that specialized in femicides, accusing Alejandro Máynez of the deaths of several women:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoy.com.ec/especial/2004/juarez/juarez.htm |title=Las muertas de Juárez (4th presentation) |author=Guadalupe Elizalde |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122220743/http://www.hoy.com.ec/especial/2004/juarez/juarez.htm |archivedate=2013-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|We were in a club when he told us that he and another person were involved in raping and murdering women... (Valenzuela, Víctor; 1999)&lt;ref name="Moreno"/&gt;}}

According to Valenzuela and Romero, Máynez had enjoyed the protection of the police in his crimes.  That year, Valenzuela was incarcerated on charges of narcotics sales, and Romero was executed.&lt;ref name="Rivera"/&gt;  Earlier, in 1995, [[Abdul Latif Sharif]] was arrested and faced charges for tens of femicides; he claimed to be innocent and accused Máynez of being the true "Juárez Ripper".

===Alejandro and Melchor===
The Máynez cousins had begun their career as serial killers in 1988, alongside their activities as traffickers.  At some point, they separated and began to kill in turns.

===Alejandro and Ana===
In 1998, Alejandro met Ana Benavides, who was working as a waitress at one of his family's bars.  Máynez's known victims also were employed in family businesses. Instead of becoming a victim, it turned out that Ana and he shared certain proclivities.  Ana was a devil-worshipping fanatic who had already claimed the lives of three people.  She quickly began to take an active part in Máynez's murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Washington Valdez|first= Diana|date= 2006|title= The Killing Fields: Harvest of Women|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UBA5tD8FVpUC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=ana+benavides+y+alejandro+maynez&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M6qV6-pbPR&amp;sig=xMcer8g_OVPZGxNb0kVFxGE0K78&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kdujT8iKO4rbgQfK3vmkCQ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ana%20benavides%20y%20alejandro%20maynez&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= 147–150|isbn= 978-0-6151-4008-7|accessdate= 19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''"El diario de Richie"''==
In 1995, a book was unveiled by an unknown author using the pseudonym "Richie". The book painstakingly compiled the events and details of several dozen murders.  It is thought that Alejandro Máynez is the author of this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Gónzalez Rodríguez|first= Sergio|date= 2003|title= Asesinos de mujeres en Ciudad Juárez|url= http://www.nodo50.org/pchiapas/mexico/noticias/juarez.htm|publisher= Geocities|isbn= 978-0-6151-4008-7|accessdate= 19 October 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120615130656/http://www.nodo50.org/pchiapas/mexico/noticias/juarez.htm|archive-date= 2012-06-15|url-status= dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the manuscript, many of the women who were murdered in Juárez were killed during orgies arranged by members of organized crime, at which they used the murders as material for [[snuff film]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731 |title=Las muertas de Juárez de Víctor Ronquillo: el morbo de la razón cínica |last1=García-García |first1=José Manuel |date=23 March 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141646/http://www.almargen.com.mx/notas.php?IDNOTA=731 |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hadj Mohammed Mesfewi '''(died June 13, 1906), called the "[[Marrakesh]] Arch-Killer", was a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[serial killer]] who murdered at least 36 women.

== Murders and execution ==
Mesfewi worked as a [[Shoemaking|shoemaker]] and trader. Supported by a 70-year-old woman named Rahali, he invited women to eat, drugged them, and killed them in their sleep.

26 corpses mutilated with a [[dagger]] were found buried under his shop, while the other ten could be discovered under another property he owned. He robbed many of his victims to enrich himself.

His execution on May 2, 1906, was supposed to be done by [[crucifixion]], but since foreign diplomats considered this method too brutal, Mesfewi was walled on June 11, 1906, in Marrakesh, and died two days later.

'''Zdzisław Marchwicki''' (October 18, 1927 – April 29, 1977), called the "[[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie|Zagłębie]] [[vampire]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rp.pl/Historia/309069927-Wampir-zZaglebia-Historia-zbrodni.html|title=Wampir z Zagłębia. Historia zbrodni|website=www.rp.pl|language=pl|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an alleged Polish [[serial killer]].

He was born in 1927 in [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]] to a lower-class family. His father went through five marriages in which four children were born—three brothers and a sister—all of whom were later charged along with Zdzisław for criminal conspiracy, robbery and obstructing justice.

Marchwicki was charged of killings committed in the following areas: in the neighbourhoods of [[Czeladź]], [[Będzin]], and adjoining towns in Zagłębie Dąbrowskie and [[Upper Silesia]]. The murders started in 1964 and continued, with occasional breaks, until late 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.murderpedia.org/male.M/m/marchwicki-zdzislaw.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been arrested in early 1972, Marchwicki was charged with the murder of fourteen women and the attempted murder of another six, but one attempted murder charge was not proven.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crimearticle/zdislaw-and-hendryck-marchwicki/&lt;/ref&gt;

After a highly publicized show trial which lasted for 10 months, Marchwicki received the death sentence in July 1975. His execution took place in 1977 in [[Katowice]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dabrowagornicza.naszemiasto.pl/zdzislaw-marchwicki-quotwampir-z-zaglebiaquot-byl-gornikiem/ar/c1-1509893|title=Zdzisław Marchwicki - &amp;quot;wampir z Zagłębia&amp;quot; był górnikiem w kopalni Zawadzki w Dąbrowie Górniczej|last=Redakcja|date=2012-08-18|website=Dąbrowa Górnicza Nasze Miasto|language=pl-PL|access-date=2019-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zdzisław's brother Jan Marchwicki also received the death penalty, while his third brother Henryk was sentenced to 25 years for taking part in a conspiracy to commit murder. The half-sister, Halina, got a three-year prison sentence for receiving stolen things such as watches and pens that she knew came from Zdzisław's victims.

Criminal penalties were given out to Halina's son, also called Zdzisław, for failing to inform the police about the murder conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;http://killer.radom.net/~sermord/New/zbrodnia.php-dzial=mordercy&amp;dane=MarchwickiZdzislaw.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Marchwicki's murder victims was the niece of [[Edward Gierek]], who was then the Upper Silesian communist party leader. However, the prosecution and the police investigators denied being pressured by political forces in the criminal prosecution of Zdzisław Marchwicki.

'''Henryk Moruś''' (born 1943 in [[Sulejów]] - died August 18, 2013 in [[Czarne]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 1993 for committing seven murders in the territory of [[Piotrków Voivodeship]]. He was the last prisoner to be sentenced to death in Poland in accordance with the European Convention of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="rzepa2001"&gt;tygodnik ''[//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rzeczpospolita_(gazeta) Rzeczpospolita]'', wydanie 980425, 2001 r.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="piotrkow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Morderca z Sulejowa bez łaski|url=http://piotrkowtrybunalski.naszemiasto.pl/wydarzenia/865547.html|agency="Dziennik Łódzki", przedruk portal wp.pl|date=19 June 2008|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
Henryk Moruś was arrested in 1992. Initially he confessed to all seven murders that were attributed to him, citing that material problems with his family was his motive. However, he declared he was innocent at the pre-trial investigation.

The prosecutor accused him of shooting seven people for robbery with his carbine. The first murder was to carried out in 1986, and the next in the first half of 1992.&lt;ref name="rzepa2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MK997"&gt;''[//pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazyn_Kryminalny_997 Magazyn Kryminalny 997]'', odcinek nr. 205, 9 grudnia 1999 r.&lt;/ref&gt; Henryk Moruś' victims were:

* Teresa Grabowska (in 1986)
* A 60-year old saleswoman from [[Piotrków Trybunalski]], murdered in her own store
* Zdzisława and Mieczysław Beśkowie (married couple from Sulejów), killed in their own home's bedroom, with the woman being pregnant in the third month&lt;ref name="7dni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tu nikt go nie ułaskawi...|url=http://egazeta.dziennik.lodz.pl/N6832_2008/06/06/2008-06-06_Tygodnik_7_Dni_Wydanie_B.pdf|author=Karolina Wojna|agency=tygodnik "7 Dni"|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Józef Jęcek, a pensioner from [[Ciechomin]]
* Jarosław Kszczot, a cement trader from [[Czarnocin, Łódź Voivodeship|Czarnocin]]
* Andrzej Kłosiński, owner of an office in [[Koluszki]].

During the long-lasting court proceedings, the accused did not speak, did not show remorse and made offensive gestures, which suggested a lack of senses (which, however, did not confirm anything). Expert psychiatrists recognized him as sane and completely accountable for his actions - they did not see him as having the capacity for higher feelings though. According to his family, he was a good husband and caring father of three children. In 1993, the Provincial Court of Piotrków Trybunalski sentenced Henryk Moruś for four murders to the death penalty with indefinite deprivation of public rights, and for three other murders and three offenses (theft, illegal alcohol and illegal possession of a firearm without a permit) to 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="rzepa1994"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprawa Morusia znów na wokandzie|url=http://new-arch.rp.pl/artykul/27088_Sprawa_Morusia_znow_na_wokandzie.html|author=Marian Strzelecki|agency=tygodnik "Rzeczpospolita"|date=17 September 1994|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeals ==
On December 3, 1993, in the proceedings before the second instance at the [[Łódź]] Court of Appeal, the sentence was lifted, returning the case for re-examination, stating that the ruling of the Piotrków court was affected by significant deficiencies. The court came to the decision that only Andrzej Kłosiński's murder could be proven at first, which was helped by admission of Moruś, who initially denied any involvement before the court. It has also not been determined whether one or more people participated in the murder, as three witnesses gave different stories. The court re-imposed the same penalty in 1995.

Two separate appeals lodged by the defenders accused the court of many contradictions contained in the court's assessment and questioned the death penalty in the current moratorium on its execution. The court of appeal, which considered defense applications, supplemented (as a rarity) evidence of new expert opinions. Ultimately, however, the lower sentence was upheld. The accused's last words were that he had not killed anyone, and that the sentence was given coldly.

In the justification, the court stressed the causal relationship between the evidence and the assessment of the first sentence. The court also issued a verdict that the death penalty does not contradict Art. 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because (according to the law), it allows for it under Polish law, and the moratorium only concerns the periodic execution of the death penalty. Defending attorney Wiktor Celler announced that he would appeal for cassation. Finally, after the abolition of the death penalty in Poland with the enforcing of the Penal Code in 1998, it was turned into a life sentence for Henryk Moruś.&lt;ref name="ziemiapiotrkowska"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ziemiapiotrkowska.pl/index.php?tydzien=173|title=Moruś will be behind bars.|author=Mariusz Jakubek|publisher="Ziemia Piotrkowska" Weekly|date=18 June 2008|access-date=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Punishment and application for pardon ==
He was detained in a prison for recidivists in a seven-person cell in the [[Wołów Prison]]. His behaviour in penitentiary services was so good that he used the right to work, sewing leather balls in the sewing room.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/arcyzbrodniarz-prosi-lecha-kaczynskiego-o-laske-6032724001879169a|title=The aristocrat asks Lech Kaczyński for grace.|author=Marek Okolny|publisher="Dziennik Łódzki"|date=30 May 2008|access-date=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he applied for a pardon to president [[Lech Kaczyński]]. He emphasized that the punishment changed his life a lot, he regrets what he did, he became a [[Jehovah's witness]] in prison and would like to spend the rest of his life there.&lt;ref name="dl"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/986609,bezwgledny-morderca-z-sulejowa-nie-zyje-henryk-morus-zmarl-w-wiezieniu,id,t.html|title=The ruthless murderer from Sulejów is dead. Henryk Moruś died in prison.|author=Marek Okolny|publisher=dzienniklodzki.pl|date=16 September 2013|access-date=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Łódź Court of Appeal issued a negative opinion on the pardon application, just the like the District Court in Piotrków - it was decided to leave the request without further progress. In November 2009, Moruś was moved due to health complications from [[Wołów]] to [[Wrocław]].&lt;ref name="autonazwa1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epiotrkow.pl/news/Morderca-z-Sulejowa-przewieziony-do-Wroclawia,3206|title=A Murderer from Sulejów transported to Wrocław|author=Marek Okolny|publisher=E.Piotrków.pl|date=23 November 2003|access-date=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Moruś died on August 18, 2013 in the prison hospital of Czarne. He was 70 years old. The most probable cause of death was atherosclerosis, ischemic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. The family did not pick up his corpse, so his burial was organised by the prison. Henryk Moruś was buried in the municipal cemetery at Sienkiewicz Street in [[Człuchów]].&lt;ref&gt;Marek Obszarny: Henryk Moruś, the murderer of seven people, has died in prison.

== Biography ==
Musiatowicz grew up in a normal household in [[Zabrze]], [[Upper Silesia]]. At the age of 15, he ran away from home and went to [[Katowice]], where he met Tadeusz O., a 52-year-old homosexual who took him under his roof and gave him little money. In 2002, when Musiatowicz was 16, with a context of financial disputes, he hit Tadeusz on the head with a hammer. Leaving him unconscious, the youngster then set the apartment on fire. Tadeusz O. later died in the hospital. Because he was a minor at the time of the crime, Musiatowicz was sentenced to only 6 years imprisonment. After leaving prison, his behavior worsened, and he began attacking shops. In 2014, he tried to rob a grocery store, terrifying the saleswoman by putting a knife to her neck, but was tackled by a customer. He later said that he was ready to cut the woman's throat if she didn't give him any money:&lt;ref name="CI Polsat"/&gt;

[[File:Zabrze_Jaskółcza_17_01_2012_DSC_6604.jpg|thumb|Jaskółcza Street in Zabrze and the surrounding woods, in which Musiatowicz did his two murders]]
Musiatowicz then made a "jump" in his life, forceful entering into the apartment of a businessman in Zabrze. He beat and tortured the man, until the victim told him where he had hidden 90,000 [[Polish złoty|złoty]] (ca. 18,000 £ or 23,500 US$). However, for an unknown reason, the businessman did not report the attack and Musiatowicz got away with it. The criminal was later detained by police and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for robbing the grocery shop, after leaving prison only eight months earlier. His parents abandoned him, considering him a bandit, thief and psychopath. He had nowhere to go, and joined a group of homeless scrap collectors who camped in a forest at Jaskółcza Street in Zabrze. The men living there drank everything that contained alcohol. One day, one of them - Daniel, got drunk and went towards the campfire, losing his toes as a result. Eryk O. and Mirosław N., who were also homeless, did not help Daniel out. Musiatowicz told Daniel "they must be cleaned up". In February 2014, Musiatowicz killed Mirosław N. with an axe, and with Daniel's help, buried the body. Eryk O. initially avoided his demise because he was arrested, only to be released two months later. Immediately after, he was killed by Musiatowicz, and again, with Daniel's help, the body was buried near the previous one. Two days later, the police started searching the area, because they had received information about bodies being buried in the area. Musiatowicz was arrested, and psychiatric tests showed he was sane. He had no remorse for his actions. In 2015, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders. He will be able to apply for early release after forty years, in 2055.&lt;ref name="CI Polsat"/&gt; Daniel, for complicity in the killings, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="wyborcza"/&gt; Musiatowicz is still considered dangerous, even while in prison:&lt;ref name="CI Polsat" /&gt;

Musiatowicz specialized in armed robberies using a dangerous tool. He spent the majority of his adult life in penitentiary institutions, telling about his crimes in an episode of the documentary series "Life-Given", conducted by journalist Mikołaj Lizut.&lt;ref name="wyborcza"/&gt;

'''Maoupa Cedric Maake''' (born 1965) (also known as the Wemmer Pan Killer) is a [[South African people|South African]] [[serial killer]]. He committed at least 27 murders throughout 1996 and 1997.

== Crimes ==

Maake is known as the "Wemmer Pan Killer" because it was in this area ([[Wemmer Pan]]) of [[Johannesburg]] that he targeted most of his victims, beginning in April 1996. At first the [[Brixton, Gauteng|Brixton]] Murder and Robbery Unit of the [[South African Police Service]] (SAPS), the unit primarily responsible for investigation of serial killers in the Johannesburg Police Area,&lt;ref name="GIS"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Schmitz, PMU |author2= Cooper, AK|author3= Byleveld, P|author4= Rossmo, DK |title= Using GIS and Digital Aerial Photography to Assist in the Conviction of a Serial Killer |url=http://researchspace.csir.co.za/dspace/bitstream/10204/2778/1/Cooper1_2000.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |location= Crime Mapping Research, 4th Annual International Conference , San Diego, California, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not link his crimes together, believing that they were the work of two separate serial killers due to the difference in patterns between the murders. During the investigation of Maake's murders, two separate [[criminal profile]]s were created; one for the "Wemmer Pan" murderer and one for "Hammer" murders.&lt;ref name="SAPS"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Holtzhausen| first = Erica|editor= Gerda van den Bos|date=October 2006| title= World Records for How Quick They Nab Serial Killers| journal= SAPS Journal (South African Police Service Journal)| pages= 20–22| publisher= The Publications and Audiovisual Media Section of Communication and Liaison Services| location= Gauteng, South Africa| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011205733/http://www.saps.gov.za/docs_publs/publications/journal/oct2006/pg20_22.pdf | archivedate = October 11, 2007 | url = http://www.saps.gov.za/docs_publs/publications/journal/oct2006/index.htm| format= PDF | accessdate = April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wemmer Pan murders involved several patterns of victims. The first were men and women walking alone who Maake bludgeoned to death with rocks. The second group of [[Wemmer Pan]] victims were couples in cars around the Wemmer Pan area whom Maake would assault, shooting the men and [[Rape|raping]] the women.&lt;ref name="SAPS" /&gt;

The second criminal profile the police created involved murders of [[tailor]]s in the inner city area, killed in their shops with hammers.&lt;ref name="SAPS" /&gt; The connection between the Wemmer Pan murders and the Hammer killings were made by Superintendent [[Piet Byleveld]] on 12 January 1998. Maake took Byleveld to a pawn shop in La Rochelle in the south of Johannesburg where he had sold the bicycle of Gerhard Lavoo, a victim in the Wemmer Pan murders, for R 120. The alias he used on the receipt was "Patrick Mokwena", the same alias he had used to check in a shirt at one of the tailors before Maake murdered him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Retief|first=Hanlie|title=Byleveld: Dossier of a Serial Sleuth|date=23 March 2012|publisher=Random House Struik|isbn=1415201439|page=130|url=https://www.amazon.com/Byleveld-Dossier-Serial-Hanlie-Retief/dp/1415201439/ref=tmm_pap_title_0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
Maake was arrested in December 1997 as a suspect of the "Wemmer Pan" murders and initially acknowledged responsibility for the crimes. He cooperated with police officers on several occasions to lead them around the vicinity and point out the locations of his crimes. The data generated by this was later used with [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) and [[crime mapping]] technology to provide diagrams of the geographical extent of the serial murders. The Wemmer Pan serial killer trial was one of the earliest uses of GIS to aid in court [[prosecution]] by the SAPS. [[Geographic profiling]] later revealed that the majority of Maake's murders were centered on his two residences, the place where he worked, and the residences of his brother and girlfriend.&lt;ref name="GIS" /&gt;

Maake was charged with 36 counts of murder, 28 attempted murders, 15 counts of rape, 46 counts of [[aggravated robbery]], and other offenses relating to the unlawful possession of [[firearm]]s and [[ammunition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090321084643/http://www.saps.gov.za/docs_publs/publications/journal/mayjun05/extra_mile.htm | archivedate = March 21, 2009| url = http://www.saps.gov.za/docs_publs/publications/journal/mayjun05/extra_mile.htm | title= Going the Extra Mile In spite of…| first= Shaun| last= Chetty|date=May–June 2005| work= SAPS Journal (South African Police Service Journal)| publisher = The Publications and Audiovisual Media Section of Communication and Liaison Services.| location = Gauteng, South Africa| accessdate = April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In court Maake pleaded not guilty to all charges.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/679141.stm|title=Serial killer jailed for 1,340 years |date=2000-03-16 |publisher=BBC.com |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month after his arrest he confessed to the "Hammer" murders.

On September 6, 2000, he was convicted of 27 murders, 26 attempted murders, 14 rapes, 41 aggravated robberies and many more less serious offenses.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He was found guilty of 114 of 134 charges in all and was sentenced to 27 [[life sentence]]s (one life sentence for each murder) plus 1159 years and 3 months imprisonment.&lt;ref name="SAPS" /&gt; In total, his sentence amounted to 1,340 years in prison.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

==In media==
Cedric Maake was featured in a 13-part [[M-Net]] television series called ''Criminal Minds'' hosted by [[Malcolm Gooding]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

'''Simon Majola''' (born 1968 in Mofolo, [[South Africa]]), known as '''The Bruma Lake Killer''', is a [[South Africa]]n robber and [[serial killer]] who, with accomplice Themba Nkosi, was responsible for the killings of at least 8 people in the vicinity of the Bruma Lake in [[Bruma, Gauteng]].&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Bruma-Lake-suspects-in-court-20010725|title=Bruma Lake suspects in court|publisher=[[News24]]|date=May 25, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majola was given 8 life sentences, and is currently behind bars.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/you-deserve-the-death-sentence-86734|title=You deserve the death sentence|author=Fikile-Ntsikelelo Moya|work=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=May 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Partnership==
Majola, a married man with two children, already had previous convictions for housebreaking, assault and theft before the murders.&lt;ref name=brag&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/im-the-bruma-lake-killer-brags-boyfriend-86888|title=I'm the Bruma Lake killer, brags boyfriend|author=Fikile-Ntsikelelo Moya and Gill Gifford|work=IOL|date=May 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While partying in [[Hillbrow]], he struck up a friendship with Themba Isaac Nkosi, of [[Vosloorus]].&lt;ref name=dredge&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/|title=Dredging up the lake serial killers|work=The Saturday Star|date=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship quickly turned into a criminal one, with Majola and Nkosi robbing and killing people not only in Bruma Lake, but also in Rhodes Park, Bezuidenhout Park and Observatory Rift Park.&lt;ref name=brag/&gt;&lt;ref name=reign&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Bruma-pairs-reign-of-terror-20010219|title=Bruma pair's 'reign of terror'|author=Lizel Steenkamp|work=News24|date=February 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Murders==
Between April 2000 and February 2001, couples' bodies were turning up in the Bruma Lake. Initially considered to be drug-related,&lt;ref name=court/&gt; the victims were apparently robbed of all cash, jewelry, bank cards, clothes and cell phones,&lt;ref name=death/&gt; before stones or bricks were tied to their feet and subsequently, they were drowned.&lt;ref name=brag/&gt; Majola and Nkosi would always work as a team, threatening their targets with knives and guns.&lt;ref name=reign/&gt; They always attacked people in the early evenings or late at night at party or picnic spots, while the victims were in their cars.&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Two of the bodies were in such an advanced state of decomposition that they were unrecognizable, with police additionally believing that they could have been foreigners.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;&lt;ref name=brag/&gt;

Despite these events terrifying the locals, causing shops to close down and business losing lots of money,&lt;ref name=death/&gt; a majority of the incidents were never reported to the authorities, as some of the couples attacked were either gay or reluctant to come forward.&lt;ref name=reign/&gt; With the lack of any kind of evidence, including fingerprints, the case proved to be a particularly difficult one, even when it was handed down to Superintendent Piet Byleveld, a sleuth noted for his successful rate of solving cases.&lt;ref name=dredge/&gt;
==Capture and trial==
On February 8, 2001, two men were arrested in [[Kensington, Gauteng|Kensington]] for the illegal possession of firearms. Those two men were Majola and Nkosi. When notified of the arrests, Byleveld immediately drove to the station in order to move the criminals to [[Brixton, Gauteng|Brixton]]. While in a separate car with Nkosi, he noticed the muscular man, who not so long ago was very cocky and considered his arrest as a joke, suddenly had begun to tremble. Later, when questioned separately, both criminals confessed to their crimes, including others of which they weren't suspected: including people robbed in Rhodes Park; the May 15, 2000 murder of a [[Baptist]] preacher and the murder of a mutual friend during a failed break-in. Majola and Nkosi also killed any associate who discovered what they were up to, killing them in the same way that they did with the other victims.&lt;ref name=dredge/&gt; Byleveld managed to connect them to at least 21 murders and attempted murders.&lt;ref name=reign/&gt;

The duo were brought to trial on September 2002. During the process, Nkosi's mother, Ruth Tshehlo, pleaded to the court to be lenient with her "first-born" child, as he was reliable.&lt;ref name=brag/&gt; Meanwhile, Majola denied all charges, blaming his convictions on [[white supremacy]].&lt;ref name=death/&gt; Neither criminal's tactics worked, as Majola was convicted on 8 counts of murder, 19 of armed robbery, and 5 of attempted murder; while Nkosi was found guilty of 4 murder charges, 14 of armed robbery, five of attempted murder and of assaulting his pregnant then-girlfriend, Jabulile Lushaba, to whom he had bragged of being the "Bruma Lake Killer".&lt;ref name=brag/&gt; Both of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=death/&gt;

'''Fanuel Makamu''' (born 1977 in [[Acornhoek]], [[Mpumalanga]]), known as the '''Mpumalanga Serial Rapist''', is a [[South Africa]]n robber, rapist and [[serial killer]]. Along with his accomplice, Henry Maile, the duo robbed, raped and killed women and nearby witnesses on streets between February and September 2000.&lt;ref name=hell&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Woman-tells-of-rape-hell-20040420|title=Woman tells of rape hell|author=Zenzele Kuhlase|publisher=[[News24]]|date=20 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maile was killed during apprehension, and Makamu was sentenced to 165 years' imprisonment.

==Murders==
Makamu and Maile started their crime spree in February 2000. They would rob and rape women on streets, and at times, shoot anybody accompanying their victims. On one such instance, on August 5, the criminals broke into a water pump station in Cottondale, where a security guard and his girlfriend were sleeping, shooting the man dead and raping the woman, killing her afterwards as well.&lt;ref name=hell/&gt;

In another case, a woman was walking towards her husband's work when the two men forced her to come with them, raping her at Magwagwaza High School in Mhala on May 11.&lt;ref name=hell/&gt;

One of the surviving victims testified about her encounter with the two men: she and a female friend were raped in Mhala on September 2, and overheard their attackers discussing how to kill them. However, Makamu and Maile simply took a cell phone and the women's clothes, and fled.&lt;ref name=hell/&gt;
==Capture and sentence==
Eventually, while trying to evade arrest, Maile was killed by police raiding his house on September 14.&lt;ref name=hell/&gt;&lt;ref name=justice&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/justice-at-last-in-makamu-case-213775|title=Justice at last in Makamu case|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=28 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makamu tried to flee, but was soon turned in by his mother after an outcry from the community.&lt;ref name=sentence&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Serial-killer-gets-165-years-20040727|title=Serial killer gets 165 years|author=Zenzele Kuhlase and Oris Mnisi|publisher=[[News24]]|date=27 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was charged with 10 counts of rape, 6 counts of murder, 5 counts of armed robbery, 2 counts of attempted murder, 3 counts of housebreaking, one of attempted robbery, one of attempted housebreaking, 2 of illegal possession of firearms, 2 of illegal possession of ammunition, one of malicious damage to property and one of attempt to escape from custody.&lt;ref name=hell/&gt; Makamu pled not guilty in front of the Circuit Court in [[Nelspruit]]; however, Judge Willy Serete found him guilty of 32 charges, acquitting him of 2 rape and robbery charges.&lt;ref name=justice/&gt;&lt;ref name=sentence/&gt;

Makamu was given 8 life sentences and 165 years of imprisonment, much to the relief of the community and his mother, Joyce Makhubela. She said that her son got what he deserved for doing such horrible crimes, and upon leaving court with her 19-year-old daughter, Sibongile, both were treated warmly by her son's victims and their families. The mayor of [[Bushbuckridge]], Milton Morema, also expressed his relief with the sentence.&lt;ref name=sentence/&gt;

'''Johannes Mashiane''', nicknamed '''The Beast of [[Atteridgeville]]''', was a [[South Africa]]n rapist and [[serial killer]] who was responsible for the deaths of 13 victims before committing suicide in 1989. Mashiane was being chased by police in the [[Pretoria]] suburb of [[Marabastad, Pretoria|Marabastad]] when he jumped underneath a bus.

Mashiane started his murderous activity in 1977 by killing his girlfriend. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and was released in 1982.&lt;ref name="Madness"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajas29.tripod.com/stats.html |title=‘‘A History of Madness’’ : Serial Killers. |access-date=2010-04-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003172900/http://ajas29.tripod.com/stats.html |archive-date=2011-10-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; After being released, he immediately started his spate of [[murder]] and [[sodomy]], accounting for the deaths of at least 12 young boys by [[strangulation]] or [[stoning]].

'''Daisy Louisa C. de Melker''' (née '''Hancorn-Smith'''; 1 June 1886 – 30 December 1932) simply known as '''Daisy de Melker''', was a trained [[nurse]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimemagazine.com/daisy-de-melker-south-africas-first-serial-killer-0 Daisy de Melker: South Africa's First Serial Killer by Marilyn Z. Tomlins]&lt;/ref&gt; who poisoned two husbands with [[strychnine]] for their life insurance money while living in [[Turffontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and then poisoned her only son with [[arsenic]] for reasons which are still unclear. She is the second woman to have been [[hanging|hanged]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Marsh| first=Rob| title=Famous South African Crimes| pages=29–32| url=http://www.africacrime-mystery.co.za/books/fsac/index.htm| accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daisy de Melker was accused of three murders but was only convicted of one, that of killing her son. The charges of poisoning her husbands were never proven in a court of law. It was William Sproat, the younger brother of her second husband, who accused her because he wanted Robert Sproat's will in favour of Daisy declared invalid. Daisy refused to refund an alleged loan from Mrs. Jane Sproat, Robert's mother, to Robert; she regarded it as a gift and argued that it was not stipulated in the will as a loan. William Sproat won the civil case regarding the will, which ran concurrently with the murder trial, and was awarded costs. Daisy withdrew on the date Justice Greenberg sentenced her for murder. William's was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] however. To pay her exorbitant legal costs, Daisy had to sell off all her assets. She was declared insolvent and was eventually buried in a prison pauper's grave.

==Early life==
Daisy Hancorn-Smith was born at Seven Fountains near [[Grahamstown]], South Africa. She was one of eleven children. When she was twelve, she went to [[Bulawayo]], [[Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]) to live with her father and two of her brothers. Three years later, she became a boarder at the Good Hope Seminary School in [[Cape Town]]. She returned to Rhodesia in 1903, but apparently found rural life unexciting, because it was not long before she returned to South Africa and enrolled at the Berea Nursing Home in [[Durban]].

On one of her holidays in Rhodesia, she met and fell in love with a young man named Bert Fuller who was a civil servant in the Native Affairs Department at [[Kabwe|Broken Hill]]. They planned to marry in October 1907. However, Fuller contracted [[blackwater fever]] and died, with Daisy at his bedside, on the very day they had planned to marry. Fuller left a will bequeathing £100 to his fiancée.

In March 1909, about eighteen months after the death of Bert Fuller, Daisy married William Alfred Cowle, a plumber in [[Johannesburg]]. She was 22 and he was 36. The couple had five children, four of whom died. The first two were twins, who died in infancy; their third child died of an abscess on the liver; and the fourth suffered convulsions and bowel trouble and died at the age of 15 months. Their last, and only surviving child, Rhodes Cecil, was born in June 1911.

==First murder: William Cowle (first husband)==
Early on the morning of 11 January 1923, William Cowle became ill soon after taking [[epsom salts]] prepared by his wife. The first doctor who attended him did not consider his condition to be serious and prescribed a [[bromide]] mixture. But Cowle's condition deteriorated rapidly. Not long after the doctor had left, he took a turn for the worse. His wife summoned the neighbors to help and called for another doctor. Cowle was in excruciating pain when the second doctor arrived. He foamed at the mouth, was blue in the face, and screamed in agony if anyone touched him, until he died.

Faced with these symptoms, the second doctor suspected [[strychnine]] [[poison]]ing and refused to sign the [[death certificate]]. A [[postmortem]] was subsequently performed by the acting District Surgeon, Dr. Fergus. The cause of death was certified to be [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[nephritis]] and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Daisy Cowle, the sole beneficiary of her husband's will, inherited £1795.

==Second murder: Robert Sproat (second husband)==
At the age of thirty-six, and three years to the day after the death of her first husband, Daisy Cowle married another plumber. His name was Robert Sproat and was ten years her senior. In October 1927, Robert Sproat became violently ill. He was in great agony and suffered severe [[spasm|muscle spasms]] similar to those experienced by William Cowle, but he recovered. A few weeks later, he suffered a second fatal attack after drinking some [[beer]] in the company of his wife and stepson, Rhodes. He died on 6 November 1927. Dr. Mallinick, the attending [[physician]], certified that the cause of death was [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. No [[autopsy]] was performed. Following Robert Sproat's death, his widow inherited over £4000, plus a further £560 paid by his pension fund.

==Third murder: Rhodes Cecil Cowle (son)==
On 21 January 1931, Daisy Sproat married for the third time. Her husband was a widower, Sydney Clarence de Melker, who, like her previous two husbands, was a [[plumber]].

Late in February 1932, Daisy de Melker had traveled from [[Germiston]] on the [[East Rand, Gauteng|East Rand]] to [[Turffontein]], to obtain arsenic from a [[pharmacist|chemist]]. She used her former name, Sproat, and claimed that she required the [[poison]] to destroy a sick [[cat]]. Less than a week later, on 2 March 1932, Rhodes fell ill at work after drinking coffee from a thermos flask which his mother had prepared for him. A fellow worker, James Webster, also become violently sick. Webster, who had drunk very little of the [[coffee]], recovered within a few days, but Rhodes died at home at midday on 5 March. A [[postmortem]] followed and the cause of death was given as [[cerebral malaria]]. Rhodes was buried at New Brixton cemetery the following day; on 1 April, de Melker received £100 from Rhodes' life insurance policy.

At the time of his death, Daisy de Melker's only son Rhodes Cowle was 20. His step-sister, Eileen de Melker, thought him lazy and remarked that he was often unwilling to get up for work in the morning. However, another witness at his mother's trial described him as "bright and conscientious" and a "real gentleman".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Certainly the evidence conflicted, but none of it explained why Daisy de Melker decided to kill Rhodes. In the case of her first two husbands, the motive seemed clearly to be financial gain.

Rhodes seems to have been under the impression that he would come into an inheritance at the age of 21. One theory is that he was demanding more than Daisy could give him and was becoming a burden to her. The most obvious answer is that she simply didn't like him and that he was a disappointment to her. She had pampered him all his life, but he rarely showed her any consideration in return.

==Arrest, trial and execution==
By this time, William Sproat (the brother of Daisy de Melker's second dead husband) had become suspicious and these suspicions were conveyed to the authorities. On 15 April 1932, the police obtained a court order permitting them to [[exhume]] the bodies of Rhodes Cowle, Robert Sproat and William Cowle.

The first body to be removed was that of Rhodes Cowle. The corpse was found to be in an unusually good state of preservation, which is characteristic of the presence of [[arsenic]] in large quantities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} A state [[forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] was able to isolate traces of arsenic in the [[viscera]], [[Vertebral column|backbone]] and [[hair]]. Although the bodies of William Cowle and Robert Sproat were largely decomposed, traces of [[strychnine]] were found in the [[vertebrae]] of each man. Their bones also had a pinkish discoloration, suggesting that the men had taken pink strychnine, which was common at the time.

Traces of arsenic were also found in the hair and fingernails of James Webster, Rhodes' colleague who had survived.

A week later, the police arrested de Melker and charged her with the [[murder]] of all three men. Public interest in the De Melker case grew, and the newspapers gave the story a great deal of coverage. The Turffontein chemist, Mr. Abraham Spilkin, from whom she had bought the arsenic that killed her son, recognized de Melker from a newspaper photograph as being "Mrs D.L. Sproat", who had signed the poisons register, and went to the police.

The de Melker trial lasted thirty days. Sixty witnesses were called for [[the Crown]] and less than half this number for the [[Defense (legal)|defense]]. To present the [[forensic evidence]], the Crown employed the services of Dr. J.M. Watt, an expert [[toxicologist]] and Professor of Pharmacology at the [[Witwatersrand University]]. In summing up, before giving his verdict, the [[judge]] pointed out that the Crown had been unable to prove conclusively that Cowle and Sproat had died of strychnine poisoning. "It does not convince me, nor does it convict the accused," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?series_number=13&amp;id=1062  Execution By hanging:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201074816/http://truecrimelibrary.com/crime_series_show.php?id=1062&amp;series_number=13 |date=2010-12-01 }} Daisy de Melker, retrieved 1932/12/30&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third count, however, he had come to the "inescapable conclusion" that de Melker had murdered her son. This was evident because:
* Rhodes Cowle had died of arsenic poisoning
* The coffee flask held traces of arsenic
* The accused had put the arsenic into the flask 
* The defense of [[suicide]] was untenable

When the judge finally turned to pass sentence on de Melker, her face whitened but she still proclaimed her innocence.

Daisy de Melker (aged 46 years) was condemned to death by hanging. The sentence was carried out on the morning of 30 December 1932 at [[Pretoria|Pretoria Central Prison]].

==Daisy de Melker in popular culture==

'''Elifasi Msomi''' a.k.a. '''The Axe Killer''' (1910--1953) was a [[South Africa]]n [[serial killer]] who was convicted in 1955 of 15 murders and sentenced to [[Death sentence|death]] by [[hanging]]. His victims all came from the [[Umkomaas]] and Umzimkulu valleys of [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

A [[Zulu people|Zulu]] man, Msomi was an unsuccessful young [[sangoma]] (shaman). Seeking professional assistance, he consulted with another sangoma. Msomi claims that during this exchange he was co-opted by an evil spirit, a [[Tikoloshe|tokoloshe]]. In August 1953, under the instruction of the tokoloshe, Msomi began an 18-month killing spree in the southern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] valleys of [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808161,00.html|title=Foreign News: Tilcoloshe's Friend|author=|date=20 February 1956|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Msomi initially raped and murdered a young woman in the presence of his mistress, whose blood he kept in a bottle. Unimpressed with his 'new' powers, his mistress alerted the police who arrested Msomi. He escaped shortly afterwards, giving credit for his escape to the all-powerful tokoloshe.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Msomi returned to his murderous ways, killing five children before being re-arrested. He duly escaped again. Msomi was arrested a month later for petty theft. The stolen items turned out to belong to his victims and he was soon identified as the murderous culprit.

Msomi readily assisted the police in finding some of his victims' remains, including a missing skull.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Whether he gained further satisfaction from revisiting his crime scenes or felt [[diminished responsibility]] in light of the tokoloshe's influence is unclear. During his trial, Msomi claimed that he was merely a conduit for the evil tokoloshe. Two psychologists disagreed, stating that Msomi was in fact of much higher than average intelligence and further that he derived sexual pleasure from inflicting pain.&lt;ref name="Return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecrimelibrary.co.uk/crime_series_show.php?id=557&amp;series_number=13|title=''True Crime Libraries'' : Worldwide Hangings.|author=|date=|website=truecrimelibrary.co.uk}}{{dead link|date=July 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Msomi was sentenced to death by hanging at Pretoria Central Prison.

Msomi's reference to the tokoloshe and his numerous escapes had however caused a high level of consternation amongst some of the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] community. Upon request, the judge permitted a deputation of nine Zulu Chiefs and Elders to attend the hanging in order to confirm that the tokoloshe did in fact not save Msomi from his death.&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt; Even so, one chief felt that Msomi might return after death as a tokoloshe himself.&lt;ref name="Return"/&gt;

'''Mukosi Freddy Mulaudzi''' (born 1962 in Maelula, [[Limpopo]]), also known as '''The Limpopo Serial Killer''', is a [[South Africa]]n robber, rapist and [[serial killer]] who murdered a total of 13 people from 1990 to 2006, until his capture in July 2006.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/limpopo-serial-killer-case-postponed-297239|title=Limpopo serial killer case postponed|work=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|IOL]]|date=11 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given 11 life sentences for his crimes.

==Murders==
Mulaudzi, who was initially imprisoned for two separate murders and an armed robbery committed in 1990, managed to break out of the Baviaanspoort Prison in [[Pretoria]] in 1996. Ever since then, he started committing crimes, beginning in 2004. During that year, he attempted to murder thrice, broke into houses two times, committed two armed robberies and assaults twice, all committed in the Siloam and [[Levubu]] areas.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=bribe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Cops-offered-me-R100-000-20061123|title='Cops offered me R100 000'|author=Nkosana ka Makaula and Nyambeni Mandiwana|work=[[News24]]|date=23 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Onwards, from 2005 to 2006, he started committing violent murders, and among his victims were:
* 19-year-old Ndivhuwo Winnity Tshilimandila, who was raped before being killed, as well as her three cousins: Nyadzeni (14), Shumani (10) and Levhalesani Maxwell Sivhugwana (7), who were all hacked to death at their home in [[Thohoyandou]].&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=bribe/&gt;
* 30-year-old Phophi Tracy Radzilani, killed with a sharp object in her house, as well as her children, Rotondwa (7) and Moses Mushiana (5), who were burned alive in their bedroom in Tshedza village. Household items were also stolen.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;&lt;ref name=bribe/&gt;
* Shonisani Thinandavha, killed in July 2006 at Mulodi, who had her breast, right hand, left ear and upper lip sliced off.&lt;ref name=hid&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2008-08-19-escaped-killer-hid-in-unused-fridge/|title=escaped killer hid in unused fridge|newspaper=[[The Sowetan|Sowetan LIVE]]|date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after killing Thinandavha, Mulaudzi was captured by police while trying to hide in an unused refrigerator.&lt;ref name=hid/&gt;
==Trial and sentence==
In October 2006, Mulaudzi briefly appeared before the court, but his case was moved to November 15, as new charges were connected to him by authorities, according to Superintendent Motlafela Mojapelo.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; Mulaudzi refused to confess and often caused scenes in the courtroom; in one instance, threatening to sleep during the proceedings if his wife, Takalani Florence Nethengwe (charged with possession of stolen goods), and son were not released, and in another, alleged that the police investigator had bribed him with money and phone cards so he would confess.&lt;ref name=bribe/&gt;&lt;ref name=hid/&gt; Eventually, he was convicted of the most charges, with Judge Godfrey Hetisani giving him 11 sentences.
